      "chunk0: Welcome to energy 101 where okay here's the deal our name is in question right now but the can the not consensus the theme is not so we ask the dumb question\n",
      "chunk1: But no question is actually dumb so they're not dumb. So you don't have? That's questionable. We as a basic questions about energy because we want to learn and we're tired of pretending like we know anything about energy. So you are here as our second guest. This is Justin\n",
      "chunk2: Goatier. Yeah, you got it. Oh my god. Yeah. I wouldn't be the first podcast. You were on that did not talk about your last name for 5 minutes. Thank you. You're welcome. Moving on. I love talking about myself in my last video. It's okay. But no, thank you so much for having me on. Pump you\n",
      "chunk3: Send me a message and I was like, absolutely, any, you know, anything to support digital wildcatters, just to be involved and at the end of the day, educating hopefully people who have a misconception about energy. That's the goal, right? Yeah. And so, not to just like start off, but I just want to start off by saying you know, we do such a good job in\n",
      "chunk4: You know especially in oil and gas like we go to these conferences and we beat our chess and we preach to the choir but like ultimately if we want to move the needle we have to educate people who are not familiar with the topics and so I think what you guys are doing are great and so I command you say you guys but you ladies nowadays you be careful. Maybe you identify something else. I don't know\n",
      "chunk5: But however, yeah, I know, super pumped to be here so thank you. Yes, we're excited. So, kind of what you were saying, we went to educate, not the echo chamber, but outside of that, we want to really reach the people who don't know anything and it's interesting because I did have a conversation yesterday. I\n",
      "chunk6: Was talking to a parent at jiujitsu. He used from San Francisco. They moved to Houston. In January to become entrepreneurs. So, they're in real estate and they're just like, this is a place to be. They know nothing about oil and gas. So, when I started like saying, talking about digital wall academies and oil and gas,\n",
      "chunk7: Energy. His immediate thought was to talk about electricity prices. And like those companies and I'm like, well, that's not exactly like what the company's do that we kind of work like our clients and who we like try to educate. Like that's different but I didn't know how to explain\n",
      "chunk8: Sure. So, how would you explain wailing gas to someone who like him? He's like, I have like, it seem like he barely even heard. Yeah. Of oil and gas. Like I think he thought of gasoline. Right. And then thought of like the electricity companies which that's not wrong. It\n",
      "chunk9: Right. How do you kind of explain that? Yeah, no, that, I mean, it's a great question and I think that's something that we need to, it's kind of like when you, when you have a company and you have a sales pitch or an elevator pitch, it's like a what do you do? You need to be able to explain it within like 30 seconds, maybe less. If not, it's people use too much energy to energy to try and figure out what the hell you're\n",
      "chunk10: Trying to talk about. So so that's an interesting question and an answer that anyone within the oil and gas baser in any space whether you're you design signs or you know you're an oiling gas or you provide electricity or you make coffee cups like you should be able to explain it simply to where people like can digest it and say oh like that may\n",
      "chunk11: Sends to me and so in in all answer your question but I I had the pleasure of having a gentleman on my podcast who connected with my wife over LinkedIn. He's in the real estate industry and he also had no idea about all the gas. He although he was from Oklahoma, he had traveled growing up quite\n",
      "chunk12: A bit and he was starting to make comments on my post just saying oh wow that was interesting or whatever so I looked at his background not when I guess related at all I was like man why don't you come on my podcast because I was like I'd be interested to hear your perspectives as someone who is outside the oil and gas you know eco\n",
      "chunk13: System like give me your honest opinion on us as an industry because I'm curious because anyone I ever talked to I mean I have people within my social circle that aren't oil and gas but they're here in Houston and so like they appreciate the industry for what it is and what it provides but this gentleman had no you know no experience with it and so I had them on and you only had a great conversation and he said man\n",
      "chunk14: Like I I listen to your podcast and he's like to be honest growing up he's like it was like the big bad oil and gas companies that all they wanted to do is you know is ruin the earth and make us much money as possible and he's like but after being you know listening to your podcast looking at your content hey you're a good guy which you know I thought everyone and all the guys who just like a bunch of rednecks who were\n",
      "chunk15: Hey I'm not big on\n",
      "chunk16: Like economics it's nice like but I I had enough of an understanding based off your podcast where I could explain like it's like the oil companies aren't the ones that you should be blaming and according to this podcast like there's this thing called supply and demand and he like tried to piece it together but ultimately I helped him and I say I you know the people that I had on\n",
      "chunk17: You know the industry helped him you know gather enough information where he could draw the conclusion where it wasn't a negative connotation towards the industry and he had enough I guess information to draw his conclusions to say okay only gas is actually extremely important I didn't realize that because he said he grew up in a\n",
      "chunk18: Family or was kind of demonized and everything else but but now he and he said I actually would love for my kids like if they told me they want to get in the oil and gas industry I would encourage them to do so because it sounds like there's plenty of opportunity and that was amazing to me like I I ultimately hope that like that next generation of his family can at least appreciate him\n",
      "chunk19: Have a decent understanding based off their dad's knowledge of the industry. So, that to me is why I podcast is for that exactly reason. So, to go back and answer your question. Like, someone comes from whatever. California, wherever and says, well, what's oil and gas? In in what do you guys\n",
      "chunk20: You didn't like ultimately it it's you know you have three parts you you you drill and you you extract. Stuff from the ground and that stuff helps create energy. It helps create cups. It helps it's hydrocarbons are the backbone for almost anything that we use. And so that\n",
      "chunk21: You know, hopefully, that's very broad but I I would I would start with like, you know, the earth has these minerals and this liquid and this gas that ultimately helps make everything you see around us. And then it's like, oh, really? Like, well, give me an example and\n",
      "chunk22: Gasoline is the easiest one, right? You know, you extract the the oil from the ground and and through different processes. I'm trying to give you like super generic. Yeah. Three different, two, three different there's a process that can, you know, essentially separated and create gasoline for your vehicle. Huh\n",
      "chunk23: You know that that's the easiest example but they're then there's there's tons out there and so it went when you had the interaction with with this gentleman his question was what is oil and gas or like how or what is you what do you ask so we are talking about\n",
      "chunk24: Is yeah what we do the the basically industry. Yeah. And I could just tell by the look on his face. He was like like what is whaling gas? Like he didn't he was it seem like he was thinking like yeah like I said gasoline or just electric companies. So\n",
      "chunk25: Like electricity companies. Right. Rather because he started talking about how it's crazy here where you have like a ton of different electricity companies to choose from. Yeah. So his mind went immediately to that. Which is fine. It's all connected. Yeah. Yeah. And so I I guess in to to like to get a little bit more\n",
      "chunk26: There's three main components of the oil and gas industry. You have the upstream which is where you everything happens out in the middle of nowhere and you drill new extract the oil and gas and you have the midstream which you transport that material to these facilities and then those facilities break up that oil and gas and then soak\n",
      "chunk27: To consumers being whether it's chemical manufacturers or you know, electricity companies. Like, and again, there's a lot more in between but that's like very high level, how that happens, and then they're talking about the utility sides, you know, yeah, we're not to get into utility market\n",
      "chunk28: It's in power markets but ultimately you know natural gas is is a big component of how we you know create power and there's natural gas that power plants and so the gas comes in it turns a turbine and then that turbine creates electricity which then they sell it to the market and so on and so forth. So, but like that's\n",
      "chunk29: Stuff that the average person would have no idea about but ultimately when you you can always reverse kind of explain it to us it's like okay so you know do you have a phone yes okay how do you charge it well electricity well do you know where that comes from well the wall the wall yeah it's like okay well like there's these plants that create the electricity and in order for them\n",
      "chunk30: To create electricity. I need some form of energy in that energy comes from you know it could come from wind because it ultimately electricity always comes from turning turbines, right? Like so whether that's through water, they give hydro electricity and you have you know wind turns the turbines. Nuclear power\n",
      "chunk31: Hours kind of different in itself but that's a lot of times is I kind of reverse explaining it and then like for my daughter actually, you know, this is a good topic for parents who have kids who are trying to explain energy. I one thing that we've taught our daughter. My son's not quite old enough to digest it but she knows now is like the critical parts of\n",
      "chunk32: Life or food, water, and energy. Like that's what you need. And so she understands her food comes from, she understands water, but the energy one was like, you know, and so it's like, we started with the wall. It's like, okay, you have your your light or whatever. And then, because she's not really know what I do, except for work on a computer and talk on the phone. Yeah. I was like, wow\n",
      "chunk33: But you know she understands now that without daddy drilling holes in the ground we won't be able to drive our cars and I say when I daddy drills the holes and then this stuff comes out of the ground and we put that stuff in the vehicle and she's like oh wait that's important. Yes it is. Until we go for the EV but\n",
      "chunk34: You know, then we explain, okay, we need electricity. Well, where is electricity come from? The electricity comes from the wall and there's these big machines that make electricity but in order to power the machines, you need the stuff that daddy gets out of the ground and so she's like connecting the dots and you know, as we've all explained more of like other technologies\n",
      "chunk35: But to like that's if you can explain it to a 6 year old hopefully you can explain to her. Yeah, I think the hardest part of understanding is like you can't see it. Like you see your food. You see the plants that it grows on. Not everyone is you know from Midland, Texas. You don't get to see the rigs that actually drill or the pump\n",
      "chunk36: Objects that are pumping the oil. So, I think that's where it becomes like non-existent to some people who don't see any energy infrastructure at all. Mm hmm. And so it's interesting that you brought up like two parts. So, yes, we had on our last episode. K McCall who she divided up energy and\n",
      "chunk37: 22 parts one was power which is your turbine so any wind exactly what you're saying. Yeah. And the other side of it would be I can't remember what she called it. I don't know if y'all remember. But basically oil and gas like what else do we make\n",
      "chunk38: From that like a side energy, aside from like power generation. Okay. Would you kind of already touch on like we need petroleum to make all the things we use. Right, there's yeah, so, I mean, so the energy side is, I would consider the energy side of it. As\n",
      "chunk39: Like power. And electricity. That to me when I think energy. That's what I think. However, there's another component that petrochemical side. And the petrochemical side is extremely important. And that's where I think you're going to see a lot of demand growth on the petrochemical side. You're going to need\n",
      "chunk40: Need a lot more that because you're creating more goods, right? As as economies continue to evolve the demand for energy and demand for just overall stuff that we see and use everyday increases. And arguably like the world's economies are continuing to grow. You know, again, that's debatable right now, but\n",
      "chunk41: For all extensive purposes you have emerging colleagues like India and China so they're just continuing to use more stuff. So in order to create more stuff you have the other side of of the energy industry that helps create feed stock for a lot and feed stock or like materials when you extract oil and gas. There's byproduct\n",
      "chunk42: After you separated through heat another forms of doing that but again in in speaking in very generalities you have when you extract the ground you can use some of that to use to boot to create electricity and then you can use a lot of that for whether be fertilizer whether it be you know chemicals like\n",
      "chunk43: That you get used in plastics and so did that I would separate like the power and then the petrochemical side and you you can only again you can break it down further and anyone who's listening is probably like well yeah but this yeah but yeah like I know everyone you know like take it easy I'm trying to keep it very simple I think that on that\n",
      "chunk44: Point that is where the industry really lacks like they like to over complicate the way they explain things because it is very in depth than technical but you can't you if you were to tell me all the technical stuff I'd be like yeah okay bye yeah but yeah yeah it's dangerous so you have to keep it high level so you know\n",
      "chunk45: Notice it like on TikTok Colin will make an explainer video and they like you mess up this like actually it's this not the point and that it doesn't matter to people outside of the industry and that's ultimately who we need to talk to. Right. Yeah. Like whether it's, you know, because again, everyone claims to be an expert. Like, you know,\n",
      "chunk46: Tiktok's a great example. I so I started as they'll take dog. Account which I go on there and I just like speak my mind. Like if I think it's something I'll go on there I'll say it and whether it's like tell me what we want to guess. Market, sales, anything and I wasn't this is a funny thing. So I was in I was in Colorado and I was in\n",
      "chunk47: Frisco Colorado. Up in the mountains and other flight for 14 chicken wings was like $27 or something and so I of course I was like oh that's crazy. I take out my phone. I'm like do it TikTok thing. I'm like $27 for chicken wings. Are you fucking kidding me? Like just kind of joking and then I I was not expecting this\n",
      "chunk48: But like so many people went on there and were like thanks Biden like Biden this and that like everyone like started getting so mad at like Biden over this post and I was like okay like I commented section on TikTok as well yeah that's where all the juices right yeah so but so the night so the night started replying and I was like well\n",
      "chunk49: I have a hard time thinking that like Biden is single handedly causing Chick fil A and that's what I was calling it. So, I mean, yeah. Like made another post. I'm like, okay, like to clear things up. Like, yeah, I get it. Like everyone is is an economist now and you know, everyone understands inflation and everyone's an expert but like let's consider supply and demand here and then,\n",
      "chunk50: Everyone's like, no, with this and that and then, I was like, okay, I need to stop. So, I like totally stop responding but to the point of everyone's in expert. Is this like, yeah, and like I come in calling for doing that. Like he's talking about like random components and different things within and nearly educating people and to go on there and then like try and it's a\n",
      "chunk51: Down here everyone I guess knows but I learned this recently out Whataburger somebody. Is that have you heard that? I've never heard that. Oh, okay. Well, like, when you go like, you know, the one uppers? Yeah. Like I'm going to want to be it's like if you went to a concert, well, the concert I went to is way better. Yeah, yeah. Another one I was at. Well, yeah, everyone like seems to think that like they're comments or what they know is\n",
      "chunk52: Is that much smarter? But ultimately, it's like, it doesn't matter. Like, the fact that like unless it was a completely offscale. It's like, if Congress talking about like a wind turbine that you used to drill oil and gas for a bit, okay, like maybe you can crack corset. Clear that up. Really? To get into the nuances and the details, it's like, he's not trying to teach a\n",
      "chunk53: Like a graduate level engineering course he's trying to help people who don't understand the industry like so let's not get caught up in the in the semantics here but yeah it's it's it's crazy and to keep it high level it's again that that is a great point is we have a hard time in oil and gas explaining what we do but then you have all these\n",
      "chunk54: Scientists and engineers been like I'm going to show you how smart I am. It's like no one gives a shit. They just want to understand what's going on. Like, can you not simplify it please? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. On that note, going to like do a little test. Can you simplify what you do to us? Yeah. So, when you drill for oil and gas\n",
      "chunk55: I'm going to assume people understand what drilling is. That's fine. Okay, so you yeah, you have this big machine that sits on the on the dirt and it drills down to get to the pool of oil and then it just gushes everywhere, right? Like it's, okay. So, but in order to get there, you need a fluid that is pumped down to where you can\n",
      "chunk56: If you're in a lake let's go let's go to the beach everyone close your eyes it's burning right when you're digging to get to China right at the beach because everyone knows if you dig deep enough you can get to China what happens yeah and then what happens? Starts to fall in, right? Like you dig, the more you dig\n",
      "chunk57: China never appears but if actually side note if you dig deep enough here in Texas to get to where you can dig to China you won't actually get to China I\n",
      "chunk58: Anywhere in the world. If you dig deep enough, you just somehow end up in China. But apparently not. No, I heard that. No, okay. Well, maybe that's a Canadian thing. No, I've heard that book. Okay, thank you. I heard it. Not that crazy. Actually, true, right? Nope. You're right. Yeah, no. These are the questions that are not dumb. Yes, if you dig deep enough, right? Here in Houston, Texas. I don't think you'll\n",
      "chunk59: End up in China. Although it'd be funny if you did but I firmly believe that growing up in British Columbia, if I dug deep enough, I would get to China but I soon found out that if you dig deep enough, what happens is the dirt and the sand falls back in on itself. So, how would you get that salmon dirt from falling in how you would, well, it,\n",
      "chunk60: What I do is I provide drilling fluid. So, as I I provide chemicals in engineering on site, meaning at the rig and we add chemicals to the fluid that gets pumped to make sure that all that rock and dirt can get lifted out of the ground so you can keep digging deeper. Cuz if you\n",
      "chunk61: Just like I say if you kept ding now if you if your hands somehow had something I could like pump fluid and like kick and spray all that dirt everywhere you might get to China yeah like at the end of your fingers if you could shoot more more water down there you might be able to get deep enough to China so it's not good so if you're digging\n",
      "chunk62: You know, owner Ray, you're digging in in your drilling. I help provide fluid to where you can continue to dig and and what happens is as you get deeper, there's there's this phenomenon called reservoir pressure, okay? And what that is is as you dig deep\n",
      "chunk63: The pressure it wants to cave in like the and then that's how ultimately oil and gas gets pushed out of the ground is because there's pressure when you dig deep there's pressure now everyone's well what about conventionals and sometimes it's depleted yeah yeah whatever but ultimately the deeper you get the more pressure there is okay so but in but as your drilling you don't\n",
      "chunk64: Want all that pressure to shoot like fluid and gas back at you because it's very dangerous. So, the fluid that I provide has a certain density and by that I mean it's heavy. So, when you did when you drill, it helps keep the whole open to where you don't have gas and oil shooting back at you because you don't want that. You only want that when you're ready to\n",
      "chunk65: Actually extract the oil in the gas but as you're drilling to get there, you want to hold it back so that you don't have issues. So, that's also part of the whole open. Yeah, it keeps the whole open so you can drill to to pleasure island which is the which\n",
      "chunk66: Is the reservoir which is the oil and the gas. Yeah. And the gold is. Yeah. Yeah. We're the black golden. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. That makes sense to me. Do you have any questions about it? No, but we're going to go into rapid fire. Are you ready? Yes, wow. So, I had no questions. I explain that perfectly. You did. I don't know if I did\n",
      "chunk67: The company I work with probably like do we should you probably questioning we probably don't even know if you said anything wrong especially going all the way to China right now we haven't dug to China yet but if we do I'll be the one to provide the fluid for it\n",
      "chunk68: Alright, here we go. Okay. What is the number one misconception about the energy industry? The energy is or oil and gas? Yeah. Okay. We're all out to ruin the earth and make as much money as humanly possible. So, would you say that because I kind of believe this that\n",
      "chunk69: I think people in the industry it's like the environment is more top of mine than anyone else like I think that we are doing a good job of trying to minimize like our effects on and I think that it's top of mind for\n",
      "chunk70: Whale and gas companies more than anyone else. Would you say that? And again, I, you know, I'm I'm someone buys because I don't have exposure to other industries who do operate in remote areas that ultimately do, you know, dig dirt and take forest away and everything else\n",
      "chunk71: However, if you look at land reclamation, especially up in Canada, when when an oil and gas company or an energy company goes and does their work, they are responsible for leaving that basically area or that land in better or in the same or better condition than what they left. They're when they got there. Yeah\n",
      "chunk72: Yeah. So, yes, it is a lot of now granted, it depends on the on the company, right? Like a lot of these huge companies, like they have a bullza on their backs. If anything happens and they're the ones, you know, you're not, you're not looking at all these small mom and pubs that, you know, if all of a sudden they burn a rig down like you're going to hear about it but if\n",
      "chunk73: Like an axon or a chevron does it? Like then it's severe but I can say this through time and I've been in oil and gas since 2004. Is the emphasis on environmental protection, land reclamation, making sure that they protect ground water. There they have spent more money in\n",
      "chunk74: In R and D on making sure that they minimize the effects on the environment then I would imagine a lot of other industries you know in in one of the biggest things right now is is the methane do you know the flaring that's a huge topic of discussion and there's a lot of companies out there that are trying to come up with technology to\n",
      "chunk75: Minimize that and find ways well now with gas at almost $10 per any BTU that's people are finding ways to try and get it to market to sell it but for a while gas is cheap and no new to do with this so they just let it they just flared it and so but but but now there's a lot of you know policy and a lot of mandates in\n",
      "chunk76: Place to see it okay we gotta minimize flaring and a lot of companies are spending a lot of money in time figuring out how to do that and so yeah there's I mean especially here in the US and in Canada they they environmental aspect of our industry is is extremely important in a lot of upcoming\n",
      "chunk77: Like they spend a lot of time and effort trying to minimize that and so but you don't see that, right? Like, it's kind of behind closed doors and they do it in, you know, people can plug their iPhones in the wall and it doesn't really mean anything. It's, you know what I mean? So, it's again, it's to your point. It's like you can't see them when they're doing that. Yeah\n",
      "chunk78: But it all adds up at the end of the day to where the US is producing in a way that's much safer and environmentally friendly than a lot of other parts of the world. And I've seen it I've experienced it. I've been in meetings and talking about like you know reducing the amount of water they use. They're reduced\n",
      "chunk79: Using the amount of people that are on the road driving those are just like a few of like tons of other things but there's these little things that make people could grab is like oh they're you know because when you frack a well they it uses a ton of water well there's everyone's trying to reduce in my water use because you know it's somewhat\n",
      "chunk80: I night. So, but yes, oil and gas companies mean it's crazy to see how much money and time they put into that because you know, investors want it. Right now, if you're an investor, you want to invest in companies that have the, you know, the environment they they have the if you're if\n",
      "chunk81: You're on the investment side most companies want invest companies that have like good ESG metrics. Like friendly. And yeah they they also certain standards. Yeah. It does again I can't\n",
      "chunk82: I I wouldn't I don't have enough experience on the operator side to say if they operate more sustainably and they have a better ESG sort of certain ESG standards or environmental standards that they operate more efficiently. I I don't know that per se. I wouldn't want to come out and say yeah if if companies have AA good environmental standards they're going to\n",
      "chunk83: Operate more efficiently but it's more efficient for the entire ecosystem to operate more efficiently because ultimately that investors are going to want to invest in companies that do operate in a good manner to where then yeah it's if we can produce more here in the US than that obviously that that would be much better so anyway that yeah it's\n",
      "chunk84: It'd be hard to make that parallel. I didn't mean to hijack you rapid fire but I do want to plug in. So, we are doing a vlog series with Precidio Patroleum and hey, we just this week released in episode and it's all about their like how they're lowering emissions. And their operations. So, I found it very\n",
      "chunk85: Very interesting and I think that other people would too which is their take on it as an oil and gas companies very interesting because I know why I had kind of some conclusions but yeah it could be just them but I hope like they're the future and others will follow. Yeah. Yeah. No. I I mean that would be something\n",
      "chunk86: I need to do more research on on that as well but and what was the operator's name? Per city. Nice. No, good for that. That's awesome. Yeah. Alright. Yeah. We kind of touch base on this one but why should i, like someone that doesn't know anything about the oil and gas industry or the energy industry, why should I care\n",
      "chunk87: You shouldn't. Yeah, don't worry about it. I just. Just keep paying your bills. It'll be fine. Yeah. You know, I, that's it. That's actually a really good question. Why should you care? Be and because it it\n",
      "chunk88: It indirectly and directly impacts your life and it impacts your kids' lives. I think that the more people can be educated, they can make sort of educated decisions. Right now, it just power. Yeah, that's exactly and so, I I think it just comes down to\n",
      "chunk89: To having a better understanding and and it helps guide your decision making. Whether that's conservative like so for someone like yourself and and I and I know this because I've spoken to people that you are in their 20s. They make a lot of their bind decisions based off of company values. So, you know, whether you're you're one of the store and if you see\n",
      "chunk90: You know, a shirt that like, oh, we, you know, we, you know, a portion of our proceeds goes to whatever environmental company versus Noah. Like, the behavior of consumers right now is like, I want to buy stuff that I line with this company values. So, yeah, and so if you have an understanding of like energy,\n",
      "chunk91: And oil and gas. It might help you make better buying decisions, not like t-shirts but yeah. It helps you understand why you're, why your electricity bill is probably going to be double. I don't know if you pay your electricity bill. But, I lived in New York and I, yeah, I got a big understanding. Yeah. Every month when I, my Con Ed Bills come in\n",
      "chunk92: Right. So, ultimately, whoever are administration is, whether it's, you know, blue, green, red, purple, whatever. Well, there's only two here in the US, but so it allows you to make better decisions when you're voting for who in\n",
      "chunk93: And it it allows you to understand policy and I think that's where ultimately if you have an understanding of energy a lot of when people when the president voting comes up a lot of their initiatives are energy policy and energy security and so if you at least have some basic understanding of that then it might help you justify why you're voting for\n",
      "chunk94: Somebody. Not to make a political but ultimately if you vote for someone who let's just say it's like we want to stop on the gas production period. Well, at least then understand that your electricity and all your energy prices are going to go up. On top of that, we're still going to use that oiling gas. So, if we can produce it where we going to get it from, over\n",
      "chunk95: Gonna depend on people from overseas and if we do that then we're giving up our energy security and I'm not going to go into energy security but that's a good sort of topic to Google is what is energy security and so that was one thing in our former administration was like energy and dependence you know again no one's perfect I'm not blue I'm not red I'm more purple than anything however\n",
      "chunk96: There there's something to be said about having a degree of energy independence because that also increases our energy security and wars have been happening for years over money and power and oil and so it all ties together and impacts us whether we want to admit it or not\n",
      "chunk97: It's again it's again like you said the more knowledgeable you are the more you have and understanding of how it all ties together you can ultimately make better decisions and more educated decisions than just soft like a motion or headlines that we see everyday. Yeah. Yeah that's a really good answer. Our last one was my favorite one. What is\n",
      "chunk98: Your most embarrassing story in your career. My most embarrassing story in my career. Oh, it's a good one. Let's see. Oh, this is a good one. Okay. And then after this, I do have to bounce ladies. But, so, I start as I was, when I graduated high school, I didn't know what I wanted to do so I started working\n",
      "chunk99: So then I went from being a city boy who enjoyed, you know, the fire things of life, partying, ladies, all that stuff as an 18 year old. Well, I went from that to going to work on a drilling rig. Well, the drilling rig that I worked on only had two cruise and for everyone out there who doesn't know, normally have more than two crews so that you can circulate but you if you only have two crews, that means that you\n",
      "chunk100: Don't really get days off. And so when that was happening, so I got on to the rig and I was like, so yeah, this this 2 week on, 2 week off thing, and they're like, no, buddy, like, you're out here until we tell you you can go home. I was like, but I thought, oh, okay, never mind. So anyway, we're\n",
      "chunk101: Gonna rig and it'd be like 3 weeks and I was like I really want to go home like I went from being at home like comforting my parents house to now working on a drilling rig and I don't know when I'm going home. This sucks. I hate it. And I was at least hand and part of my job on a day-to-day basis was cleaning the like the rigs, toilets, and like the bathroom\n",
      "chunk102: And in Canada the trailer the two pushers trailer and the two pushers kind of like the boss on the rig well anyway at the end of his trailer was the bathroom so 1 day I was cleaning the bathroom and I was trying to figure like how I could get home it was like well wait you know like I have you know a wedding coming up I was like okay so what I was tuned bears to go\n",
      "chunk103: Went to the to the my bosses trailer through the front door but from the bathroom to the door they're from like the bathroom that I was cleaning there was a door to his office and I heard him in there on the phone and so I waited in the bathroom till he was done on the phone then I knocked on the door and his name was Daryl and he was like hello I was like\n",
      "chunk104: Hey Daryl this is Justin cleaning your the bathroom right now I was wondering if you had a minute and he's like what the hell are you doing call me from the bathroom like I don't know and so you open the door he's like you're the first person that's ever done he's like what do you want my I haven't been home in a my I have a wedding coming up and I was wondering if I could be home for you know I\n",
      "chunk105: Gave my date and he didn't give me an answer but that was like looking back if if I was a like a boss and some kid like was cleaning the bathroom and knocked on the door to ask for days off out of probably ran him off and then like don't erase him for days off while you're cleaning the bathroom. That's just so awkward\n",
      "chunk106: So it's it's not really embarrassing but it's like in looking back at it like I was I didn't know how to approach my boss and so yeah I was saying there was like a scrub brush and like like gloves and stuff like cleaning the bathroom asking for time off like looking bad like I wasn't embarrassed at the time but now I'm like wow that was extremely embarrassing. Yeah. I don't know why I thought of that. I'm taking this picture\n",
      "chunk107: Scrubbing the toilet. Hey boss, by the way, can I go home tomorrow? Yeah, like can I, yeah, can I, can I have some diesel? In the crappy thing is like you never gave me an answer for like 2 weeks. So, he kept like dragging me along. I was like, goddamn and then, he finally was like, okay, he's like, look, yes, you can, you can go home for these dates but then you gotta come back, you know, these dates. Music, but if you ever ask me\n",
      "chunk108: For time off from the bathroom again you might as well not come back I was like okay noted yeah I'll come in through the front door instead of through the bathroom yeah yeah so that was normal thing I'm sure you probably this dumb kid but yeah that's I don't know if that's the most embarrassing but I'm embarrassed to like describe that so\n",
      "chunk109: Hi to my career for sure. Yeah. Yeah. Well, cool. Thanks for coming on. I know you have a meeting to run to. No way. This has been fun. Yeah. You ladies are crushing it and I'm super pumped to see how this evolves and like I said, evolve or die, right? Yeah, exactly. Yeah, I think, we'll have you on when we know a little bit more and you can talk to us. More in depth. Yeah\n",
      "chunk110: No worries. I hope I didn't okay job. It's again, it's I'm working on explaining things simply to people who don't quite understand it. So I think this is a good exercise and and a great platform to do that. So, I command you ladies. It's such a good idea. Awesome. Well, thank you Justin. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you guys. Should we plug your podcast? Oh, sure\n",
      "chunk111: Followers. Thank you. Yeah. We got one subscriber our moms are here. Yeah. Yeah. No. My mom's always like I listen to your podcast. Yeah. So yeah, if you want to so again, I have a podcast wicked energy with JG. You can find it on all directories. In it folks is around having\n",
      "chunk112: Discussions about you know, a lot of the challenges, the innovation, the transition, in in through speaking in interviewing energy thought leaders, and so yeah, just continue to educate, dive deep into a lot of the challenges, and, and just some really good discussion on oil and gas, whether it's technology, Paul is\n",
      "chunk113: See you know the transition so to all things good for energy so and then two is like how a lot of the conversation I like to have is how can we help provide energy to the world because I think one of the problems is you know it's one thing to help you know reduce emissions and everything else but I think the biggest problem we have right now is energy poverty and\n",
      "chunk114: Lots of parts of the world is so how can we how can we allow for people to have access to reliable abundant and affordable energy I think that needs to be the north star and then beyond that we can continue focusing on you know reducing emissions and and all you know the greenhouse gas effects and everything else but but that's a privilege yeah it it is right\n",
      "chunk115: And so there's countries out there who don't care about emitting. They just want to be able to heat their hospitals and have electricity so they can have babies in a nice environment versus on the dirt floor. So, keep that in mind. Yes, well, thank you, Justin. Yeah. Thank you\n"
