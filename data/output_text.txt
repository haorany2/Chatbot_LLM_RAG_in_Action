[0.00s -> 10.70s]  welcome to energy 101 where okay here's the deal our name is in question right now but 
[10.70s -> 21.08s]  the consistent can the not consensus the theme is not so we ask the dumb questions but no question 
[21.08s -> 24.82s]  is actually dumb so they're not dumb so you don't have that's questionable 
[24.82s -> 32.38s]  we ask the basic questions about energy because we want to learn and we're tired of pretending like 
[32.38s -> 38.56s]  we know anything about energy um so you are here as our second guest this is 
[38.56s -> 46.18s]  justin gauthier yeah you got it oh my god yeah i wanted to be the first podcast you were on 
[46.18s -> 52.40s]  that did not talk about your last name for five minutes thank you you're welcome moving on 
[52.40s -> 54.84s]  i love talking 
[54.86s -> 59.60s]  about myself and my last name oh it's okay uh but no thank you so much for having me on i'm 
[59.60s -> 64.22s]  pumped you sent me a message and i was like absolutely any you know anything to support 
[64.22s -> 69.74s]  digital wildcatters is to be involved and at the end of the day educating hopefully people who 
[69.74s -> 76.02s]  have a misconception about energy um that's the goal right and so not to just like start off but 
[76.02s -> 80.94s]  i just want to start off by saying um you know we do such a good job and you know especially in oil 
[80.94s -> 84.84s]  and gas like we go to these conferences and we beat our chest and we preach to the choir 
[84.84s -> 90.26s]  but like ultimately if we want to move the needle we have to educate people who are not familiar with 
[90.26s -> 95.58s]  the topics and so i think what you guys are doing are great um and so i commend you i'd say you guys 
[95.58s -> 100.28s]  but you ladies nowadays you'd be careful um maybe you identify something else i don't know but 
[100.28s -> 108.12s]  however uh yeah no super pumped to be here so thank you yeah so excited um so kind of what you 
[108.12s -> 114.16s]  were saying we we want to educate not the echo chamber but outside of that we want to really 
[115.06s -> 119.04s]  educate people who don't know anything and it's interesting because i did have a conversation 
[119.04s -> 125.54s]  yesterday i was talking to a parent at jujitsu he's from san francisco they moved to houston 
[125.54s -> 132.42s]  um in january to become entrepreneurs so they are in real estate and they're just like this 
[132.42s -> 137.86s]  is a place to be they know nothing about oil and gas so when i started like saying talking 
[137.86s -> 144.74s]  about digital wildcatters and oil and gas energy his immediate thought was to talk about 
[145.06s -> 150.72s]  um electricity prices and like those companies and i'm like well that's not exactly like 
[150.72s -> 158.47s]  what the companies do that we kind of work like our clients and who we like try to educate like 
[158.47s -> 164.07s]  that's different but i didn't know how to explain that sure so how would you explain oil and gas 
[164.07s -> 170.13s]  to someone who like him he's like i have like it seemed like he had barely even heard 
[170.13s -> 175.43s]  yeah of oil and gas like i think he thought of gasoline right and then thought of like 
[175.67s -> 182.75s]  the electricity companies which that's not wrong it's just how do you kind of explain that yeah 
[182.75s -> 186.99s]  no that i mean it's a great question and i think that's something that we need to it's kind of like 
[186.99s -> 191.15s]  when you go when you have a company and you have a sales pitch or an elevator pitch it's like well 
[191.15s -> 196.81s]  what do you do you need to be able to explain it within like 30 seconds maybe less if not it's 
[196.81s -> 200.49s]  people use too much energy to energy to try and figure out what the hell you're trying to talk 
[200.49s -> 205.71s]  about um so so that's an interesting question and an answer that anyone within the oil and 
[205.83s -> 212.23s]  gas space or in any space whether you're um you design signs or you know you're in oil and gas or 
[212.23s -> 216.75s]  you provide electricity or you make coffee cups like you should be able to explain it simply to 
[216.75s -> 223.95s]  where people like can digest it and say oh like that makes sense to me um and so and i'll answer 
[223.95s -> 229.03s]  your question but uh i had the pleasure of having a gentleman on my podcast who connected with my 
[229.03s -> 235.81s]  wife over linkedin he's in the real estate uh industry and he also had no 
[235.83s -> 240.43s]  idea about oil and gas he although he was from oklahoma he had traveled growing up quite a bit 
[240.43s -> 247.31s]  and um he was starting to make comments on my posts um just saying oh wow that was interesting 
[247.31s -> 251.39s]  or whatever and so i looked at his background not oil and gas related at all i was like man 
[251.39s -> 255.23s]  why don't you come on my podcast because i was like i'd be interested to hear your perspective 
[255.23s -> 262.43s]  as someone who is outside the oil and gas you know ecosystem like give me your honest opinion 
[262.43s -> 265.51s]  on us as an industry because i'm curious because anyone i ever talked to 
[265.83s -> 269.41s]  i mean i have people within my social circle that aren't oil and gas but they're here in 
[269.41s -> 272.95s]  houston and so like they appreciate the industry for what it is and what it provides but 
[272.95s -> 277.89s]  this gentleman had no you know no experience with it and so i had him on and you know we 
[277.89s -> 282.65s]  had a great conversation and he said man like i i listened to your podcast and he's like to be 
[282.65s -> 286.85s]  honest growing up he's like it was like the big bad oil and gas companies that all they wanted 
[286.85s -> 292.21s]  to do is you know is ruin the earth and make as much money as possible and he's like but after 
[292.21s -> 295.81s]  being you know listening to your podcast looking at your content a you're a good guy you're a good 
[295.83s -> 299.59s]  guy which you know i thought everyone in oil and gas was just like a bunch of rednecks who 
[299.59s -> 305.65s]  were mean right or whatever like whatever the perception was um so you know we got that sort 
[305.65s -> 311.17s]  of you know biases out of the window and then you know he he said yeah after he's like i listened to 
[311.17s -> 315.19s]  one of your podcasts and it was funny because that same day he was with his friends and they 
[315.19s -> 320.63s]  were complaining about gas prices and then he's like you know i'm not not big on like economics 
[320.63s -> 325.11s]  this and that he's like but i i had enough of an understanding based off your podcast where i could 
[325.83s -> 330.51s]  like the oil companies aren't the ones that you should be blaming and according to this podcast 
[330.51s -> 335.29s]  like there's this thing called supply and demand and he like tried to piece it together but 
[335.29s -> 341.53s]  ultimately i helped him and i say i you know the people that i had on you know the industry helped 
[341.53s -> 348.08s]  him uh you know gather enough information where he could draw the conclusion where it wasn't a 
[348.08s -> 353.84s]  negative connotation towards the industry and he had enough i guess information to draw his 
[353.84s -> 355.90s]  conclusions to say okay oil and gas are not the ones that you should be blaming and you should be 
[355.92s -> 356.34s]  blaming the people that you should be blaming and i said well i think the oil and gas is actually 
[356.34s -> 360.54s]  extremely important i didn't realize that um because he said he grew up in a family where 
[360.54s -> 365.42s]  it was kind of demonized and everything else but but now he and he said i actually would love for 
[365.42s -> 368.80s]  my kids like if they told me they wanted to get in the oil and gas industry i would encourage 
[368.80s -> 373.26s]  them to do so because it sounds like there's plenty of opportunity and that was amazing to 
[373.26s -> 379.68s]  me like i i ultimately hope that like that next generation of his family can at least appreciate 
[379.68s -> 385.86s]  and have a decent understanding based off their dad's knowledge of the industry so um that to me 
[385.92s -> 393.94s]  is why i podcast is for that exact reason so to go back and answer your question like someone 
[393.94s -> 399.60s]  comes from whatever california or wherever and says well what's oil and gas um and and what do 
[399.60s -> 405.18s]  you guys do like ultimately it's you know you have three parts you you you drill and you you 
[405.18s -> 414.84s]  extract stuff from the ground and that stuff helps create energy it helps create cups it helps it's 
[414.84s -> 415.90s]  hydrocarbons are the backbone of the industry and it's the backbone of the industry and it's the 
[415.92s -> 423.74s]  backbone for almost anything that we use um and so that you know hopefully that's very broad 
[423.74s -> 431.46s]  but i i would i would start with like you know the earth has these minerals and this liquid and this 
[431.46s -> 438.72s]  gas that ultimately helps make everything you see around us um and then it's like oh really like 
[438.72s -> 446.26s]  give me an example and gasoline is the easiest one right um you know you extract the oil from 
[446.26s -> 452.02s]  the ground and and through different processes i'm trying to keep it like super generic through 
[452.02s -> 457.26s]  different to through different uh there's a process that can you know essentially separate 
[457.26s -> 463.20s]  it and create gasoline for your vehicle um you know that that's the easiest example but 
[463.20s -> 470.52s]  then there's there's tons out there uh and so when you had the interaction with with this 
[470.52s -> 475.76s]  gentleman were you his question was what is oil and gas or like how 
[476.26s -> 483.64s]  what is you didn't ask so we were talking about just yeah what we do the in the basically um 
[483.64s -> 490.36s]  industry yeah and i could just tell by the look on his face he was like like what is oil oil and gas 
[490.36s -> 496.52s]  like he didn't he was it seemed like he was thinking like yeah like i said gasoline or just 
[496.52s -> 502.88s]  um electric companies so like electricity companies right rather because he started 
[502.88s -> 506.06s]  talking about uh how it's crazy here 
[506.26s -> 510.58s]  um where you have like a ton of different electricity companies to choose from oh yeah 
[510.58s -> 517.36s]  so his mind went immediately to that which is fine it's all connected right yeah yeah and so i i guess 
[517.36s -> 522.60s]  in to to like to get a little bit more technical i guess like i would if someone asked me i would 
[522.60s -> 526.92s]  say well there's three main components of of the oil and gas industry you have the upstream which 
[526.92s -> 531.30s]  is where you everything happens out in the middle of nowhere and you drill and you extract the oil 
[531.30s -> 535.94s]  and gas and you have the midstream which you transport that material to these facilities 
[536.26s -> 542.48s]  and then those facilities break up that oil and gas and then sell it to consumers being 
[542.48s -> 548.16s]  whether it's chemical manufacturers or you know electricity companies like and again there's a 
[548.16s -> 553.40s]  lot more in between but that's like very high level how that happens and then like talking 
[553.40s -> 561.03s]  about the utility size is you know yeah we're not to get into utility markets and power markets but 
[561.03s -> 566.53s]  ultimately you know the natural gas is is a big component of how we're going to be able to 
[566.55s -> 572.23s]  you know create power and there's natural gas process like power plants and so the gas comes 
[572.23s -> 576.47s]  in it turns a turbine and then that turbine creates electricity which then they sell it to 
[576.47s -> 581.85s]  the market and so on and so forth so but like that's stuff that the average person would have 
[581.85s -> 587.33s]  no idea about but ultimately when you you can always reverse kind of explain it too is it's 
[587.33s -> 592.33s]  like okay so you know do you have a phone yes okay how do you charge it well electricity well 
[592.33s -> 596.43s]  do you know where that comes from well the wall the wall yeah and then it's like okay well like 
[596.55s -> 601.03s]  there's these plants that create the electricity and in order for them to create electricity they 
[601.03s -> 608.66s]  need some form of energy and that energy comes from you know it could come from wind because 
[608.66s -> 612.92s]  ultimately electricity always comes from turning turbines right like so whether that's through 
[612.92s -> 620.24s]  water like you have hydroelectricity and you have you know wind turns the turbines nuclear power is 
[620.24s -> 625.62s]  kind of different in itself but that's a lot of times is like kind of reverse explaining it and 
[625.62s -> 626.56s]  then like for my 
[626.58s -> 631.84s]  daughter actually you know this is a good topic for parents who have kids who are trying to explain 
[631.84s -> 635.98s]  energy and like one thing that we've taught our daughter my son's not quite old enough to like 
[635.98s -> 642.32s]  digest it but she knows now is like the critical parts of life are food water and energy like 
[642.32s -> 646.16s]  that's what you need and so she understands where food comes from she understands water 
[646.16s -> 651.14s]  but the energy one was like you know and so it's like we started with the wall it was like okay you 
[651.14s -> 656.44s]  have your your light or whatever and then because she doesn't really know what i do except for 
[656.58s -> 661.90s]  working on a computer and talk on the phone okay i was like well the reason i do that is because 
[661.90s -> 668.44s]  blah blah but you know she understands now that without daddy drilling holes in the ground we 
[668.44s -> 672.66s]  wouldn't be able to drive our cars and i say when i daddy drills the holes and then this stuff comes 
[672.66s -> 676.76s]  out of the ground and we put that stuff in the vehicle and she's like oh wait that's important 
[676.76s -> 682.64s]  yes it is until we go fully ev but you know then we explain okay we need electricity well where 
[682.64s -> 686.56s]  does the electricity come from the electricity comes from the wall and there's a lot of energy 
[686.58s -> 691.46s]  these big machines that make electricity but in order to power the machines you need the stuff 
[691.46s -> 697.34s]  that daddy gets out of the ground and so she's like connecting the dots and you know as we evolve 
[697.34s -> 704.20s]  we'll explain more of like other technologies but to like that's if you can explain it to a six-year-old 
[704.20s -> 708.76s]  hopefully you can explain it to another adult yeah i think the hardest part of understanding 
[708.76s -> 714.08s]  it is like you can't see it like you see your food you see the plants that it grows on not 
[714.08s -> 716.56s]  everyone is um you know from middle school you can't see it you can't see it you can't see it 
[716.58s -> 721.72s]  you don't get to see the rigs that actually drill or the pump jacks that are pumping the oil so 
[721.72s -> 728.92s]  i think that's where it becomes like non-existent to some people who don't see any energy 
[728.92s -> 735.44s]  infrastructure at all um and so it's interesting that you brought up like two parts so yes we had 
[735.44s -> 744.64s]  on our last episode kay mccall who she divided up energy into two parts one was power yeah which is 
[744.64s -> 746.56s]  your turbine so any wind exactly and then the other one was power and so it's like you know 
[746.58s -> 752.12s]  yeah and the other side of it would be i can't remember what she called it i don't know if y'all 
[752.12s -> 763.01s]  remember but basically oil and gas like what else do we make from that like aside energy aside from 
[763.01s -> 770.43s]  like power generation okay um which you kind of already touched on like we need petroleum to make 
[770.43s -> 777.09s]  all the things we use right there's yeah so i mean so the energy side is 
[777.25s -> 783.11s]  i would consider the energy side of it as like power and electricity that to me when i think 
[783.11s -> 789.37s]  energy that's what i think however there's another component the petrochemical side and the 
[789.37s -> 795.27s]  petrochemical side is extremely important and that's where i think you're going to see a lot 
[795.27s -> 801.19s]  of demand growth on the petrochemical side um you're going to need a lot more of that because 
[801.19s -> 806.03s]  you're creating more goods right as as economies continue to evolve 
[807.64s -> 813.36s]  the demand for energy and demand for just overall stuff that we see and use every day increases 
[813.36s -> 818.88s]  and arguably like the world's economies are continuing to grow you know again that's 
[818.88s -> 823.28s]  debatable right now but for all extents of purposes you have emerging economies like 
[823.28s -> 828.22s]  india and china and stuff they're just continuing to use more stuff so in order to create more stuff 
[828.22s -> 836.22s]  you have the other side of of the energy industry that helps create feedstock for a lot and feedstock 
[836.22s -> 837.62s]  are like material so when you extract the energy from the energy industry you're creating a lot of 
[837.64s -> 845.02s]  oil and gas there's byproducts after you separate it through heat and other forms of doing that but 
[845.02s -> 850.50s]  again in gen speaking in very generalities you have when you extract stuff out of the ground 
[850.50s -> 854.80s]  you can use some of that to use to create electricity and then you can use a lot of that 
[854.80s -> 861.52s]  for whether it be fertilizer whether it be you know chemicals like that you get used in plastics 
[861.52s -> 867.52s]  and so that i would separate like the power and then the petrochemical side and you you can all 
[867.64s -> 871.60s]  again you can break it down further and anyone who's listening is probably like well yeah but 
[871.60s -> 877.40s]  this yeah but yeah like i know everyone you know like take it easy um i'm trying to keep it very 
[877.40s -> 884.80s]  simple um i think that on that point that is where um the industry really lacks like they like to 
[884.80s -> 890.56s]  over complicate the way they explain things because it is very in-depth and technical but 
[890.56s -> 895.38s]  you can't you if you were to tell me all the technical stuff i'd be like yeah okay bye 
[895.38s -> 897.48s]  yeah but yeah yeah it's interest 
[897.64s -> 901.26s]  so you have to keep it high level so you do you notice it like on tiktok 
[901.26s -> 906.30s]  colin will make an explainer video and they like you mess up this like actually it's this and it's 
[906.30s -> 911.26s]  like i know that's not the point and that it doesn't matter to people outside of the industry 
[911.26s -> 916.98s]  and that's ultimately who we need to talk to right yeah and like whether it's you know because 
[916.98s -> 922.44s]  again everyone claims to be an expert like you know tiktok's a great example i would so i started 
[922.44s -> 927.65s]  this little tiktok account which i go on there and i just like speak my mind like i'm like i'm 
[927.67s -> 930.71s]  like if i think it's something i'll go on there i'll say it and whether it's like talking about 
[930.71s -> 937.53s]  oil and gas markets sales anything and i was in this is the funniest thing so i was in i was in 
[937.53s -> 945.55s]  colorado and uh i was in frisco colorado so up in the mountains and like for 14 chicken wings was 
[945.55s -> 950.39s]  like 27 or something and so i so of course i was like oh that's crazy i take out my phone i'm like 
[950.39s -> 955.09s]  do a tiktok thing i'm like 27 for chicken wings are you fucking kidding me and like 
[955.09s -> 956.97s]  just kind of joking and then 
[957.96s -> 963.92s]  i i was not expecting this but like so many people went on there and were like thanks biden 
[963.92s -> 969.92s]  like biden this and that like everyone like started getting so mad at like biden over this 
[969.92s -> 975.38s]  post and i was like okay like the comment section on tiktok is wild yeah that's where all the juice 
[975.38s -> 981.36s]  is right yeah so but so then i so then i started replying and i was like well i i have a hard time 
[981.36s -> 985.58s]  thinking that like biden is single-handedly causing chickflation that's what i was calling 
[985.58s -> 988.14s]  it and so i mean yeah and so then 
[988.18s -> 992.12s]  i like made another post i'm like okay like to clear things up like yeah i get it like everyone 
[992.12s -> 996.96s]  is is an economist now and you know everyone understands inflation and everyone's an expert 
[996.96s -> 1001.88s]  but like let's consider supply and demand here and then everyone was like no but this and that 
[1001.88s -> 1006.68s]  and then i was like okay i need to stop so i like totally stopped responding but to the point of 
[1006.68s -> 1012.52s]  everyone's an expert is this like yeah and like i commend colin for doing that like he's talking 
[1012.52s -> 1017.18s]  about like random components and different things within and then like educating people and to go on 
[1018.18s -> 1022.94s]  like try and it's a term down here everyone i guess knows but i learned this recently out 
[1022.94s -> 1028.44s]  whataburger somebody is that have you heard that i've never heard that oh okay well when like when 
[1028.44s -> 1032.80s]  you go like you know one uppers yeah like i'm gonna one up you it's like if you went to a concert 
[1032.80s -> 1036.88s]  well the concert i went to was way better like you should have been the one i was at well yeah 
[1036.88s -> 1040.78s]  everyone like seems to think that like their comments or what they know is that much smarter 
[1040.78s -> 1046.26s]  um but ultimately it's like it doesn't matter like the fact that like unless it was like completely 
[1046.26s -> 1048.16s]  off scales like if you're like you're like you're like you're like you're like you're like you're 
[1048.16s -> 1052.24s]  colin was talking about like a wind turbine that you used to drill oil and gas for i'd be like okay 
[1052.24s -> 1058.68s]  like maybe you can correct course here to get into the nuances and the details it's like he's not 
[1058.68s -> 1063.42s]  trying to teach a like a graduate level engineering course he's trying to help people who don't 
[1063.42s -> 1069.06s]  understand the industry and like so let's not get caught up in the in the semantics here um but yeah 
[1069.06s -> 1074.72s]  it's it's it's crazy and to keep it high level it's again that that is a great point is we have 
[1078.16s -> 1082.36s]  um but then you have all these scientists and engineers been like i'm gonna show you how smart 
[1082.36s -> 1086.26s]  i am it's like no one gives a shit they just want to understand what's going on like can you not 
[1086.26s -> 1094.02s]  simplify it please yeah yeah on that note gonna like do a little test can you simplify what you 
[1094.02s -> 1102.06s]  do to us uh yeah so when you drill for oil and gas i'm gonna assume people understand what 
[1102.06s -> 1107.38s]  drilling is that's fine okay so you yeah you have this big machine that sits on the on the dirt and 
[1108.16s -> 1113.78s]  down to get to the pool of oil and then it just gushes everywhere right like that's okay so but 
[1113.78s -> 1121.92s]  in order to get there you need a fluid that is pumped down to where you can if you're in a like 
[1121.92s -> 1127.42s]  let's go to the beach everyone close your eyes when you're digging to get to china right at the 
[1127.42s -> 1131.72s]  beach because everyone knows if you dig deep enough you can get to china what happens when 
[1131.72s -> 1138.28s]  you start digging what happens the sand gets wet yeah and then what happens starts to fall in right 
[1138.70s -> 1143.26s]  i've never dug that i'm like i'm like i was just at the beach and i'm like what happened 
[1143.26s -> 1149.46s]  so you dig down then all of a sudden you get down there and and then the the sand wants to fall in 
[1149.46s -> 1153.50s]  and you're like well i can't see china yet so you keep digging and just china never appears but if 
[1153.50s -> 1158.80s]  actually side note if you dig deep enough here in texas to get to where you can dig to china you 
[1158.80s -> 1162.12s]  won't actually get to china i thought anywhere in the world if you dig deep enough you just somehow 
[1162.12s -> 1167.04s]  end up in china but apparently not i've never heard that no okay well maybe that's a canadian 
[1167.04s -> 1168.54s]  thing no i've heard that okay 
[1168.70s -> 1174.40s]  thank you i'm not that crazy it's not actually true right no you're right yeah no these are the 
[1174.40s -> 1179.90s]  questions that are not dumb yes if you dig deep enough right here in houston texas i don't think 
[1179.90s -> 1186.34s]  you'll end up in china uh although it'd be funny if you did but i firmly believe that growing up in 
[1186.34s -> 1191.52s]  british columbia if i dug deep enough i would get to china but i soon found out that if you dig deep 
[1191.52s -> 1196.70s]  enough what happens is the dirt and the sand falls back in on itself so how would you get that sand 
[1196.70s -> 1198.68s]  and dirt from falling in how do you get that sand and dirt from falling in how do you get that sand 
[1198.70s -> 1206.68s]  you would well what i do is i provide drilling fluid so i i provide chemicals in engineering 
[1206.68s -> 1214.58s]  on site meaning at the rig and we add chemicals to the fluid that gets pumped to make sure that 
[1214.58s -> 1219.06s]  all that rock and dirt can get lifted out of the ground so you can keep digging deeper 
[1219.06s -> 1223.92s]  because if you just like i say if you kept digging now if if your hand somehow had 
[1223.92s -> 1228.68s]  something that could like pump fluid and like kick and spray all that dirt everywhere you 
[1228.70s -> 1234.04s]  might get to china yeah like at the end of your fingers if you could shoot more more water down 
[1234.04s -> 1240.52s]  there you might be able to get deep enough to china so so again so if you're digging uh you 
[1240.52s -> 1247.56s]  know on a rig you're digging and you're drilling um i help provide fluid to where you can continue 
[1247.56s -> 1256.98s]  to dig and and what happens is as you get deeper there's there's this phenomenon called reservoir 
[1256.98s -> 1259.64s]  pressure okay and what that is is as you dig deeper you get deeper and you get deeper and you 
[1259.66s -> 1264.42s]  dig deeper the pressure one it wants to cave in like the and then that's how ultimately oil and 
[1264.42s -> 1268.28s]  gas gets pushed out of the ground is because there's pressure when you dig deep there's 
[1268.28s -> 1273.06s]  pressure now everyone's like well what about conventionals and sometimes it's depleted yeah 
[1273.06s -> 1278.46s]  yeah yeah whatever but ultimately the deeper you get the more pressure there is okay so but in but 
[1278.46s -> 1283.62s]  as you're drilling you don't want all that pressure to shoot uh like fluid and gas back 
[1283.62s -> 1289.38s]  at you because it's very dangerous so the fluid that i provide has a certain density 
[1289.66s -> 1295.36s]  and by that i mean it's heavy so when you did when you drill it helps keep the hole open to 
[1295.36s -> 1299.14s]  where you don't have gas and oil shooting back at you because you don't want that you only want 
[1299.14s -> 1303.62s]  that when you're ready to actually extract the oil and the gas but as you're drilling to get there 
[1303.62s -> 1311.40s]  you want to hold it back so that you don't have uh issues so that's also basically suppresses 
[1311.40s -> 1318.48s]  and keeps the hole open yeah it keeps the hole open so you can drill to to pleasure island which 
[1318.48s -> 1318.90s]  is the 
[1319.66s -> 1325.24s]  which is the reservoir which is the oil and the gas yeah the gold is yeah yeah where the black 
[1325.24s -> 1331.84s]  gold is yeah yeah okay that makes sense to me do y'all have any questions about it no but we're 
[1331.84s -> 1337.06s]  gonna go into rapid fire are you ready yes wow so i no questions i explained that perfectly 
[1337.06s -> 1343.12s]  i don't know if i did the company i work for is probably like do we should you should probably 
[1343.12s -> 1349.08s]  yeah and we're questioning the we probably don't even know if you said anything wrong 
[1349.66s -> 1357.52s]  especially going all the way to china right now we haven't dug to china yet but if we do i'll be the 
[1357.52s -> 1364.64s]  one to provide the fluid for it all right here we go okay what is the number one misconception 
[1364.64s -> 1372.61s]  about the energy industry the energy or oil and gas or oil and gas okay um that we're all out to 
[1372.61s -> 1378.75s]  ruin the earth and make as much money as humanly possible so would you say that because i kind of 
[1378.75s -> 1379.49s]  believe this that 
[1380.11s -> 1388.76s]  i think um people in the industry it's like the environment is more top of mind than anyone else 
[1388.76s -> 1398.11s]  like i think that we are doing a good job of trying to minimize yeah like our effect on and 
[1398.11s -> 1403.63s]  i think that it's top of mind for oil and gas companies more than anyone else would you say that 
[1403.63s -> 1408.85s]  i would say that and and again i you know i'm somewhat biased because i don't have exposure to 
[1408.85s -> 1410.89s]  other industries who are doing a good job of minimizing our impact on the environment and i 
[1410.91s -> 1412.89s]  think about all the different industries that are doing a good job of minimizing our impact on the 
[1412.89s -> 1413.71s]  environment and i think about all the different industries that are doing a good job of minimizing 
[1413.71s -> 1414.51s]  our impact on the environment and i think about all the different industries that ultimately do 
[1414.51s -> 1421.88s]  you know dig dirt and take forest away and everything else however if you look at land 
[1421.88s -> 1427.02s]  reclamation especially up in canada when when an oil and gas company or an energy company goes 
[1427.02s -> 1433.72s]  and does their work they are responsible for leaving that basically area or that land in 
[1433.72s -> 1440.62s]  better or in the same or better condition than what they left there when they got there yeah so 
[1441.10s -> 1459.36s]  So yes, it is a lot of oil. Now, granted, it depends on the on the company, right? Like a lot of these huge companies, like they have a bullseye on their backs. If anything happens and they're the ones, you know, you're not you're not looking at all these small mom and pops that, you know, all of a sudden they burn a rig down like you're going to hear about it. 
[1459.36s -> 1478.10s]  But if like an Exxon or a Chevron does it like then it's severe. But I can say this through time and I've been in oil and gas since 2004 is the emphasis on environmental protection, land reclamation, making sure that they protect groundwater there. 
[1478.10s -> 1487.78s]  They have spent more money in R&D on making sure that they minimize the effects on the environment than I would imagine a lot of other industries. 
[1487.78s -> 1501.80s]  You know, and one of the biggest things right now is the methane, you know, the flaring. That's a huge topic of discussion. And there's a lot of companies out there that are trying to come up with technologies to minimize that and find ways. 
[1501.80s -> 1512.96s]  Well, now with gas at almost ten dollars per BTU, that's people are finding ways to try and get it to market to sell it. But for a while, gas is cheap and no one knew what to do with it. So they just let it they just flared it. 
[1512.96s -> 1517.46s]  And so but but but now there's a lot of, you know, population. 
[1517.78s -> 1526.12s]  Policy and a lot of mandates in place to say, OK, we got to minimize flaring and a lot of companies are spending a lot of money and time figuring out how to do that. 
[1526.12s -> 1538.91s]  And so, yeah, there's I mean, especially here in the U.S. and in Canada, like the environmental aspect of our industry is is extremely important. 
[1538.91s -> 1547.71s]  And a lot of companies like they spend a lot of time and effort trying to minimize that. And so but you don't see that right. 
[1547.71s -> 1547.95s]  Right. 
[1548.33s -> 1554.45s]  It's kind of behind closed doors and they do it. And, you know, people can plug their iPhones in the wall and it doesn't really mean anything. 
[1554.45s -> 1559.43s]  It's you know what I mean? So it's again, to your point is it's like you can't see them when they're doing that. 
[1559.59s -> 1559.81s]  Yeah. 
[1561.07s -> 1571.80s]  But it all adds up at the end of the day to where the U.S. is producing in a way that's much safer and environmentally friendly than a lot of other parts of the world. 
[1572.86s -> 1578.50s]  And I've seen it and I've experienced it and I've been in meetings and talking about like, you know, reducing the amount of water. 
[1578.58s -> 1581.84s]  They use they're reducing the amount of people that are on the road driving. 
[1583.02s -> 1586.34s]  Those are just like a few of like tons of other things. 
[1586.34s -> 1595.10s]  But there's these little things that make people can grasp is like, oh, they're you know, because when you frack a well, it uses a ton of water. 
[1595.50s -> 1600.26s]  Well, everyone's trying to reduce the amount of water we use because, you know, it's somewhat finite. 
[1600.26s -> 1608.26s]  So but yes, oil and gas companies mean it's crazy to see how much money and time they put into that because, you know, 
[1608.58s -> 1610.12s]  investors want it right now. 
[1610.22s -> 1620.93s]  If you're an investor, you want to invest in companies that have the, you know, the environment like they have the if you're if you're on the investment side, 
[1620.99s -> 1627.65s]  most companies want to invest in companies that have like good ESG metrics like friendly. 
[1627.65s -> 1632.39s]  And yeah, they also think it increases efficiency in some aspects. 
[1633.17s -> 1635.85s]  Yeah, it it does. 
[1638.00s -> 1638.94s]  Again, I can't. 
[1640.06s -> 1652.12s]  I wouldn't I don't have enough experience on the operator side to say if they operate more sustainably and they have a better ESG sort of certain ESG standards or environmental standards that they operate more efficiently. 
[1652.38s -> 1654.64s]  I I don't know that per se. 
[1654.64s -> 1660.82s]  I wouldn't want to come out here and say, yeah, if companies have a good environmental standards, they're going to operate more efficiently. 
[1661.04s -> 1669.80s]  But it's more efficient for the entire ecosystem to operate more efficiently because ultimately then investors are going to want to invest in companies that do operate. 
[1670.06s -> 1678.63s]  In a good manner to where then, yeah, it's if we can produce more here in the US, then that obviously that that would be much better. 
[1678.73s -> 1681.59s]  So anyway, that yeah, it's it'd be hard to make that parallel. 
[1681.59s -> 1685.47s]  I didn't mean to hijack your rapid fire, but I do want to plug in. 
[1685.79s -> 1697.81s]  So we are doing a vlog series with Presidio Petroleum and we just this week released an episode and it's all about their like how they're lowering lowering emissions and their operations. 
[1698.69s -> 1700.23s]  So I found it very, very. 
[1700.25s -> 1700.69s]  Very interesting. 
[1700.91s -> 1703.55s]  And I think that other people would, too. 
[1703.67s -> 1707.23s]  It's just their take on it as an oil and gas company is very interesting. 
[1707.79s -> 1711.78s]  That's kind of why I had kind of some conclusions. 
[1712.34s -> 1713.96s]  But yeah, it could be just them. 
[1714.06s -> 1717.04s]  But I hope like they're the future and others will follow. 
[1717.48s -> 1717.70s]  Yeah. 
[1718.12s -> 1718.34s]  Yeah. 
[1718.42s -> 1722.16s]  No, I mean, that would be something I need to do more research on on that as well. 
[1722.26s -> 1723.82s]  But and what was the operator's name? 
[1724.74s -> 1725.52s]  Presidio Petroleum. 
[1725.54s -> 1726.16s]  Presidio Petroleum. 
[1726.36s -> 1726.68s]  Nice. 
[1726.88s -> 1727.42s]  No, good for them. 
[1727.46s -> 1727.90s]  That's awesome. 
[1728.38s -> 1728.50s]  Yeah. 
[1728.50s -> 1729.08s]  All right. 
[1729.24s -> 1729.44s]  Yeah. 
[1729.60s -> 1730.48s]  We kind of touched. 
[1730.50s -> 1731.40s]  We kind of touched based on this one. 
[1731.50s -> 1736.62s]  But why should I like someone that doesn't know anything about the oil and gas industry or the energy industry? 
[1736.76s -> 1737.58s]  Why should I care? 
[1740.08s -> 1741.30s]  You shouldn't. 
[1741.36s -> 1741.92s]  I'm just kidding. 
[1743.96s -> 1744.80s]  That's the answer. 
[1746.08s -> 1746.48s]  Yeah. 
[1746.52s -> 1747.34s]  Don't worry about it. 
[1747.90s -> 1748.36s]  I just. 
[1749.24s -> 1750.30s]  Make our lives easier. 
[1750.40s -> 1750.56s]  Yeah. 
[1750.56s -> 1751.16s]  It'll be there. 
[1751.26s -> 1752.24s]  Just keep paying your bills. 
[1752.40s -> 1753.00s]  It'll be fine. 
[1753.14s -> 1753.88s]  Just keep living. 
[1754.50s -> 1754.60s]  Yeah. 
[1754.72s -> 1757.85s]  You know, that's actually a really good question. 
[1757.93s -> 1758.75s]  Why should you care? 
[1758.75s -> 1761.05s]  Because it indirectly. 
[1761.37s -> 1765.15s]  And directly impacts your life and it impacts your kids lives. 
[1766.75s -> 1774.99s]  And I think that the more people can be educated, they can make sort of educated decisions. 
[1775.07s -> 1776.09s]  Knowledge is power. 
[1776.45s -> 1777.69s]  Yeah, that's exactly. 
[1777.87s -> 1786.23s]  And so I think it just comes down to having a better understanding and and it helps guide your decision making, whether that's conserving. 
[1786.23s -> 1791.31s]  Like so for someone like yourself and I and I know this because I've spoken to people that, you know, 
[1791.37s -> 1796.75s]  in their 20s, they make a lot of their buying decisions based off of company values. 
[1796.75s -> 1816.15s]  So, you know, whether you're going to the store and if you see a, you know, a shirt that like, oh, we, you know, you know, a portion of our proceeds goes to whatever environmental company versus no one like the behavior of consumers right now is like, I want to buy stuff that I align with this company values. 
[1816.15s -> 1817.49s]  So, yeah. 
[1817.59s -> 1820.85s]  And so if you have an understanding of like energy and oil and gas. 
[1820.85s -> 1830.85s]  It might help you make better buying decisions, not like T-shirts, but yeah, it helps you understand why you're why your electricity bill is probably going to be double. 
[1830.85s -> 1840.13s]  I don't know if you pay your electricity bill, but I lived in New York and I yeah, I got a big understanding every month when I my con ed bills coming in. 
[1840.19s -> 1843.07s]  I'm like, OK, why in the summer price is getting higher, you know? 
[1843.19s -> 1846.35s]  Yeah. So here on a macro level, it allows you. 
[1846.39s -> 1850.85s]  OK, so ultimately, whoever our administration is, whether it's, you know, blue. 
[1850.85s -> 1852.75s]  Green, red, purple, whatever. 
[1853.47s -> 1861.95s]  Well, there's only two here in the US, but so it allows you to make better decisions when you're voting for and it allows you to understand policy. 
[1862.09s -> 1873.59s]  And I think that's where ultimately, if you have an understanding of energy, a lot of when people when the president voting comes up, a lot of their initiatives are energy policy and energy security. 
[1873.59s -> 1880.55s]  And so if you at least have some basic understanding of that, then it might help you justify why you're voting for somebody. 
[1880.85s -> 1888.05s]  Not to make it political, but ultimately, if you vote for someone who, let's just say, is like, we want to stop oil and gas production, period. 
[1888.21s -> 1892.99s]  Well, at least then understand that your electricity and all your energy prices are going to go up. 
[1893.80s -> 1897.36s]  On top of that, we're still going to use that oil and gas. 
[1897.50s -> 1899.64s]  So if we can't produce it, where are we going to get it from? 
[1899.72s -> 1901.68s]  Oh, we're going to depend on people from overseas. 
[1901.68s -> 1904.34s]  And if we do that, then we're giving up our energy security. 
[1904.92s -> 1910.48s]  And I'm not going to go into energy security, but that's a good sort of topic to Google is what is energy security? 
[1910.60s -> 1910.92s]  And so. 
[1910.92s -> 1914.30s]  That was one thing in our former administration was like energy independence. 
[1915.62s -> 1916.88s]  You know, again, no one's perfect. 
[1917.04s -> 1917.70s]  I'm not blue. 
[1917.80s -> 1918.24s]  I'm not red. 
[1918.28s -> 1919.44s]  I'm more purple than anything. 
[1919.58s -> 1926.86s]  However, there is something to be said about having a degree of energy independence because that also increases our energy security. 
[1927.30s -> 1934.04s]  And wars have been happening for years over money and power and oil. 
[1934.04s -> 1939.66s]  And so it all ties together and impacts us whether we want to admit it or not. 
[1940.64s -> 1946.30s]  It's again, it's again, like you said, the more knowledgeable you are, the more you have an understanding of how it all ties together. 
[1946.50s -> 1953.72s]  You can ultimately make better decisions and more educated decisions than just off like emotion or headlines that we see every day. 
[1954.00s -> 1954.22s]  Yeah. 
[1954.78s -> 1956.38s]  Yeah, that's a really good answer. 
[1956.86s -> 1957.84s]  Our last one. 
[1957.92s -> 1958.84s]  That's my favorite one. 
[1959.14s -> 1961.84s]  What is your most embarrassing story in your career? 
[1962.42s -> 1964.04s]  My most embarrassing story in my career. 
[1964.76s -> 1966.08s]  Oh, that's a good one. 
[1966.98s -> 1967.90s]  Let's see. 
[1968.82s -> 1969.96s]  Oh, this is a good one. 
[1969.98s -> 1973.36s]  And then after this, I do have to bounce ladies. 
[1974.02s -> 1975.48s]  But so I started. 
[1975.58s -> 1979.10s]  So I was when I graduated high school, I didn't know what I wanted to do. 
[1979.14s -> 1980.48s]  So I started working drilling rigs. 
[1980.88s -> 1987.94s]  So then I went from being a city boy who enjoyed, you know, the finer things of life, partying, ladies, all that stuff as an 18 year old. 
[1988.16s -> 1989.84s]  Well, I went from that to going to work on a drilling rig. 
[1989.94s -> 1992.38s]  Well, the drilling rig that I worked on only had two crews. 
[1992.38s -> 1998.06s]  And for everyone out there who doesn't know, normally have more than two crews so that you can circulate. 
[1998.06s -> 1999.96s]  But if you only have two crews, that means that you. 
[1999.96s -> 2001.60s]  You don't really get days off. 
[2002.80s -> 2011.04s]  And so when that was happening, so I got onto the rig and I was like, so, yeah, this is two week on, two week off thing. 
[2011.04s -> 2014.58s]  And they're like, nobody like you're out here until we tell you can go home. 
[2014.58s -> 2017.90s]  And I was like, but I thought, oh, OK, never mind. 
[2017.90s -> 2024.86s]  So anyway, we're going to rig and it had been like three weeks and I was like, I really want to go home. 
[2024.86s -> 2028.82s]  Like I went from being at home, like comfort of my parents house to now working on a drilling rig. 
[2028.82s -> 2029.90s]  And I don't know. 
[2029.90s -> 2031.34s]  When I'm going home, this sucks. 
[2031.34s -> 2032.46s]  I hated it. 
[2032.46s -> 2034.22s]  And I was a lease hand. 
[2034.22s -> 2040.90s]  And part of my job on a day to day basis was cleaning the like the rigs, toilets and like the bathrooms. 
[2040.90s -> 2046.22s]  And in Canada, the trailer, the two pushers trailer and the two pushers kind of like the boss on the rig. 
[2046.22s -> 2048.20s]  Well, anyway, at the end of his trailer was the bathroom. 
[2048.20s -> 2053.42s]  So one day I was cleaning the bathroom and I was trying to figure out like how I could get home. 
[2053.42s -> 2057.08s]  And I was like, well, wait, you know, like I have a wedding coming up. 
[2057.08s -> 2058.94s]  I was like, OK, so what? 
[2058.94s -> 2059.80s]  I was too embarrassed to go home. 
[2059.80s -> 2073.30s]  I had to go into the to the my boss's trailer through the front door, but from the bathroom to the door or from like the bathroom that I was cleaning, there was a door to his office and I heard him in there on the phone. 
[2073.30s -> 2075.64s]  And so I waited in the bathroom till he was done on the phone. 
[2075.64s -> 2078.68s]  Then I knocked on the door and his name was Darryl. 
[2078.68s -> 2083.86s]  And he was like, oh, I was like, hey, Darryl, this is Justin cleaning the bathroom right now. 
[2083.86s -> 2086.68s]  I was wondering if he had a minute and he's like, what the hell are you doing? 
[2086.68s -> 2087.92s]  Call me from the bathroom. 
[2087.92s -> 2089.60s]  I don't know. 
[2089.60s -> 2090.10s]  Open the door. 
[2090.14s -> 2091.68s]  He's like, you're the first person that's ever done. 
[2091.70s -> 2092.60s]  He's like, what do you want? 
[2093.10s -> 2097.24s]  Like, well, I haven't been home and I have a wedding coming up. 
[2097.24s -> 2103.43s]  And I was wondering if I could be home for, you know, I gave him a date and he didn't give me an answer. 
[2103.43s -> 2114.51s]  But that was like looking back, if if I was like a boss and some kid like was cleaning the bathroom and knocked on the door to ask for days off, I would have probably ran him off. 
[2114.79s -> 2118.97s]  I've been like, don't ever ask me for days off while you're cleaning the bathroom. 
[2119.05s -> 2119.81s]  That's just so awkward. 
[2119.83s -> 2125.67s]  And so it's not really that embarrassing, but it's like in looking back at it, like I was I didn't know how to approach my boss. 
[2125.75s -> 2132.71s]  And so, yeah, I was sitting there with like a scrub brush and like like gloves and stuff, like cleaning the bathroom, asking for time off, like looking back. 
[2132.81s -> 2137.37s]  Like I wasn't embarrassed at the time, but now I'm like, wow, that was extremely embarrassing. 
[2137.83s -> 2139.15s]  I don't know why I thought of that. 
[2139.19s -> 2140.53s]  I'm sure this picture is scrubbing the toilet. 
[2140.65s -> 2142.87s]  Hey, boss, by the way, can I go home tomorrow? 
[2143.15s -> 2143.23s]  Yeah. 
[2143.33s -> 2145.39s]  Like, can I yeah, can I can I have some days off? 
[2145.43s -> 2148.33s]  And the crappy thing is like he never gave me an answer for like two weeks. 
[2148.33s -> 2149.65s]  So he kept like. 
[2149.83s -> 2150.51s]  Hanging it along. 
[2150.61s -> 2151.41s]  I was like, God dang. 
[2151.47s -> 2157.85s]  And then he finally was like, OK, he's like, look, yes, you can you can go home for these dates, but then you got to come back, you know, these dates. 
[2158.17s -> 2163.17s]  He's like, but if you ever ask me for time off from the bathroom again, you might as well not come back. 
[2163.23s -> 2164.31s]  I was like, OK, noted. 
[2164.47s -> 2167.25s]  Yeah, I'll come in through the front door instead of through the bathroom door. 
[2167.31s -> 2167.49s]  Yeah. 
[2167.81s -> 2168.13s]  Yeah. 
[2168.23s -> 2169.83s]  So that was the normal thing. 
[2170.07s -> 2171.67s]  I'm sure he's probably this dumb kid. 
[2171.67s -> 2177.29s]  But yeah, that's I don't know if that's the most embarrassing, but I'm embarrassed to like describe that. 
[2177.29s -> 2178.87s]  So I don't really get that much. 
[2179.03s -> 2179.51s]  But yeah. 
[2179.63s -> 2179.79s]  Yeah. 
[2179.83s -> 2180.43s]  It does work. 
[2180.53s -> 2181.67s]  Highlight of my career for sure. 
[2181.69s -> 2181.87s]  Yeah. 
[2182.05s -> 2182.31s]  Yeah. 
[2183.01s -> 2183.51s]  Well, cool. 
[2184.07s -> 2185.23s]  Thanks for coming on. 
[2185.35s -> 2186.67s]  I know you have a meeting to run to. 
[2186.79s -> 2187.25s]  No worries. 
[2187.33s -> 2188.07s]  This has been fun. 
[2188.25s -> 2188.43s]  Yeah. 
[2188.69s -> 2189.77s]  You ladies are crushing it. 
[2189.81s -> 2192.03s]  And I'm super pumped to see how this evolves. 
[2192.11s -> 2193.93s]  And like I said, evolve or die. 
[2193.99s -> 2194.21s]  Right. 
[2194.33s -> 2194.61s]  Yeah. 
[2194.79s -> 2195.15s]  Exactly. 
[2195.25s -> 2195.41s]  Yeah. 
[2195.59s -> 2199.57s]  We'll have you on when we know a little bit more and you can talk to us more in depth. 
[2199.69s -> 2199.93s]  Yeah. 
[2200.01s -> 2200.49s]  No worries. 
[2200.53s -> 2201.75s]  I hope I did an OK job. 
[2201.75s -> 2207.05s]  It's again, it's I'm working on explaining things simply to people who don't quite understand it. 
[2207.43s -> 2209.79s]  So I think this is a good exercise and a great. 
[2209.83s -> 2210.69s]  Platform to do that. 
[2210.77s -> 2211.69s]  So I commend you ladies. 
[2211.89s -> 2213.11s]  It's such a good idea. 
[2213.25s -> 2213.61s]  Awesome. 
[2213.73s -> 2214.55s]  Well, thank you, Justin. 
[2214.73s -> 2215.05s]  Yeah. 
[2215.15s -> 2215.83s]  You're welcome. 
[2215.95s -> 2216.53s]  Thank you guys. 
[2216.73s -> 2218.69s]  Should we plug your podcast? 
[2218.95s -> 2219.49s]  Oh, sure. 
[2219.55s -> 2220.75s]  Our non-existent followers. 
[2221.57s -> 2223.31s]  You guys are going to have lots. 
[2223.47s -> 2225.13s]  I'll make sure my mom subscribes. 
[2225.31s -> 2225.87s]  Thank you. 
[2225.91s -> 2226.13s]  Yeah. 
[2226.25s -> 2227.15s]  We got one subscriber. 
[2227.31s -> 2227.89s]  Our moms are. 
[2228.07s -> 2228.31s]  Yeah. 
[2228.51s -> 2228.79s]  Yeah. 
[2228.91s -> 2230.89s]  No, my mom's always like, I listen to your podcast. 
[2232.21s -> 2233.29s]  So, yeah, if you want to. 
[2233.67s -> 2235.85s]  So, again, I have a podcast, Wicked Energy with JG. 
[2235.97s -> 2239.71s]  You can find it on all directories and it focuses around. 
[2239.83s -> 2250.65s]  Having discussions about, you know, a lot of the challenges, the innovation, the transition in through speaking and interviewing energy thought leaders. 
[2250.65s -> 2264.81s]  And so, yeah, just continue to educate, dive deep into a lot of the challenges and and just some really good discussion on oil and gas, whether it's technology policy, you know, the transition sort of all things good for energy. 
[2264.99s -> 2269.35s]  So and then two is like how a lot of the conversation I like to have is how can we. 
[2269.83s -> 2276.51s]  Help provide energy to the world, because I think one of the problems is, you know, it's one thing to help, you know, reduce emissions and everything else. 
[2277.09s -> 2280.83s]  But I think the biggest problem we have right now is energy poverty in lots of parts of the world. 
[2280.83s -> 2287.85s]  So how can we how can we allow for people to have access to reliable, abundant and affordable energy? 
[2287.99s -> 2289.79s]  I think that needs to be the North Star. 
[2289.95s -> 2297.31s]  And then beyond that, we can continue focusing on, you know, reducing emissions and and all the greenhouse gas effects and everything else. 
[2297.31s -> 2298.61s]  But but that's a privilege. 
[2298.95s -> 2299.79s]  Yeah, it is. 
[2299.85s -> 2300.07s]  Right. 
[2300.11s -> 2302.71s]  And so there's countries out there who don't care about emitting. 
[2302.71s -> 2310.25s]  They just want to be able to heat their hospitals and have electricity so they can have babies in a nice environment versus on a dirt floor. 
[2310.39s -> 2311.53s]  So keep that in mind. 
[2312.07s -> 2312.29s]  Yes. 
[2312.37s -> 2313.31s]  Well, thank you, Justin. 
[2313.53s -> 2313.83s]  Yeah. 
[2314.35s -> 2314.97s]  Thank you.
