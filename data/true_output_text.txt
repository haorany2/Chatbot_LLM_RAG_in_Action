welcome to energy 101 where okay here's the deal our name
is in question right now but the consistent can the
not consensus the theme is not so we ask the dumb questions but no
question is actually dumb so they're not dumb so you don't have that's questionable [Laughter]
we asked the basic questions about energy because we want to learn and we're tired of pretending like
we know anything about energy um so you are here as our second guest this is
justin gautier yeah you got it oh my god yeah i wanted to be the first podcast
you were on that did not talk about your last name for five minutes thank you you're welcome
moving on i love talking about myself though it's okay uh
but no thank you so much for having me on i'm pumped you sent me a message and i was like absolutely any you know
anything to support digital wildcatters just to be involved and at the end of the day educating
hopefully people who have a misconception about energy um that's the goal right yeah and so not to
just like start off but i just want to start off by saying um you know we do such a good job and
you know especially in oil and gas like we go to these conferences and we beat our chess and we preach to the choir but like ultimately if we want to move the
needle we have to educate people who are not familiar with the topics and so i think what you guys are doing are great um and so i commend
you say you guys but you ladies nowadays you'll be careful um maybe you identify something else i don't know but however
uh yeah no super pumped to be here so thank you yeah so we're excited um so
kind of what you were saying we yeah want to educate not the echo chamber but outside of that we want to
really reach the people who don't know anything and it's interesting because i did have a conversation
yesterday i was talking to a parent at jiu-jitsu he's from san francisco they
moved to houston um in january to become entrepreneurs so
they are in real estate and they're just like this is a place to be they know nothing about oil and gas so when i started like
saying talking about digital wallet calories and oil and gas energy his immediate
thought was to talk about um electricity prices and like those companies and i'm
like well that's not exactly like what the companies do that we
kind of work like our clients and who we like try to educate like that's different but i didn't know how to explain that sure so how would you
explain oil and gas to someone who like him he's like i have like
it seemed like he had barely even heard of oil and gas like i think he thought of gasoline right and then thought of
like the electricity companies which that's not wrong it's just how do you kind of
explain that yeah no that i mean it's a great question and i think that's something that we need to it's kind of like when you go when you have a company
and you have a sales pitch or an elevator pitch it's like well what do you do you need to be able to explain it within
like 30 seconds maybe less if not it's people use too much energy energy to try
and figure out what the hell you're trying to talk about um so so that's an interesting question and an answer that
anyone within the oil and gas space or in any space whether you're um you design
signs or you know you're an oil and gas or you provide electricity or you make coffee cups like you should be able to
explain it simply to where people like can digest it and say oh like that makes sense to me um
and so and i'll answer your question but i i had the pleasure of having a gentleman on my podcast who connected with my wife
over linkedin he's in the real estate uh industry and
he also had no idea about oil and gas he although he was from oklahoma he had traveled growing up quite a bit and
um he was starting to make comments on my posts um just saying oh wow that was
interesting or whatever and so i looked at his background not oily gas related at all i was like man why don't you come
on my podcast cause i was like i'd be interested to hear your perspective as someone who is outside the oil and gas
you know ecosystem like give me your honest opinion on us as an industry because i'm curious because anyone i
ever talk to i mean i have people within my social circle that aren't oil and gas but they're here in houston and so they
appreciate the industry for what it is and what it provides but this gentleman had no you know no experience with it
and so i had him on and you know we had a great conversation and he said man like i i listened to your podcast and
he's like to be honest growing up he's like it was like the big bad oil and gas companies all they wanted to do is you
know is ruin the earth and make as much money as possible and he's like but after being you know listening to your
podcast looking at your content a you're a good guy which you know i thought everyone in olympia was just like a
bunch of rednecks who were mean right or whatever like whatever the perception was um so you
know we got that sort of you know biases out of the window and then you know he he he said yeah
after he's like i listened to one of your podcasts and it was funny because that same day he was with his friends and they were
complaining about gas prices and then he's like you know i'm not i'm not big on like economics this and that he's
like but i i had enough of an understanding based off your podcast where i could explain like it's like the oil companies aren't the ones
that you should be blaming and according to this podcast like there's this thing called supply and demand and he like
tried to piece it together but ultimately i helped him and i say i you know the
people that i had on you know the industry helped him uh you know
gather enough information where he could draw the conclusion where it wasn't a negative connotation towards the
industry and he had enough i guess information to draw his conclusions to say okay oil and
gas is actually extremely important i didn't realize that um because he said he grew up in a family or it was kind of
demonized and everything else but but now he and he said i actually would love for my kids like if they told me they
want to get in the oil and gas industry i would encourage them to do so because it sounds like there's plenty of opportunity and that was amazing to me
like i i ultimately hope that like that next generation of his family can at
least appreciate and have a decent understanding based off their dad's knowledge of the industry so um that to
me is why i podcast is for that exact reason so to go back and answer your
question like someone comes from whatever california or wherever and says well
what's oil and gas um and what do you guys do like ultimately it's you know you have three
parts you you you drill and you you extract stuff from the ground and that stuff
helps create energy it helps create cups it helps it's hydrocarbons are the
backbone for almost anything that we use um and so that you know hopefully
that's very broad but i would i would start with like you
know the earth has these minerals and this liquid and this gas that ultimately helps make everything
you see around us um and then it's like oh really like well give me an example
and gasoline is the easiest one right um you know you extract the oil from the ground
and through different processes i'm trying to keep you like super generic
through different through different uh there's a process that can actually you know essentially
separate it and create gasoline for your vehicle um you know that that's the easiest example
but then there's there's tons out there uh and so
when you had the interaction with with this gentleman were his question was what is oil and gas or
like how or what is so we were talking about just yeah what
we do the in the basically um industry yeah and i could just tell by
the look on his face he was like like what is oil and gas like he didn't
he was it seemed like he was thinking like yeah like i said gasoline or just
um electric companies so like electricity companies right rather
because he started talking about uh how it's crazy here um where you have like a
ton of different electricity companies to choose from oh yeah so his mind went immediately to that
which is fine it's all connected right yeah yeah and so i guess in
to to like to get a little bit more technical i guess like i would if someone asked me i would say well there's three main components of of the
oil and gas industry you have the upstream which is where you everything happens out in the middle of nowhere and you drill and you
extract the oil and gas and you have the midstream which you transport that material to these facilities and then
those facilities break up that oil and gas and then sell it to consumers
being whether it's chemical manufacturers or you know electricity companies like and
again there's a lot more in between but that's like very high level how that happens and then like talking about the
utility sizes you know yeah we're not to get into
utility markets and power markets but ultimately you know the natural gas is is a big
component of how we create you know create power and there's natural gas process like power plants and so the gas
comes in it turns a turbine and then that turbine creates electricity which then they sell it to the market and so
on and so forth so but like that's stuff that the average person would have no idea about but
ultimately when you you can always reverse kind of explain it too is it's like okay so you know do
you have a phone yes okay how do you charge it well electricity well do you know where that comes from well the wall
the wall yeah and then it's like okay well like there's these plants that create the electricity and in order for
them to create electricity they need uh some form of energy
and that energy comes from you know it could come from wind because ultimately electricity always comes from
turning turbines right like so whether that's through water you give hydroelectricity then you have you know
wind turns the turbines nuclear power is kind of different in
itself but that's a lot of times is like kind of reverse explaining it and then like for
my daughter actually you know this is a good topic for parents who have kids who are trying to
explain energy and like one thing that we've taught our daughter my son's not quite old enough to like digest it but
she knows now is like the critical parts of life or food water and energy like that's what you need and so she
understands where food comes from she understands water but the energy one was like you know and so i was like we started with the wall
it's like okay you have your your light or whatever and then because she doesn't really know what i
do except for work on a computer and talk on the phone i was like well the reason i do that
is because blah blah but you know she understands now that without daddy drilling holes in the
ground we wouldn't be able to drive our cars and i say when i daddy drills the holes and then this stuff comes out of
the ground and we put that stuff in the vehicle and she's like oh wait that's important yes it is
until we go fully ev but you know then we explain okay we need electricity well where does electricity come from the
electricity comes from the wall and there's these big machines that make electricity but in order to power the
machines you need the stuff that daddy gets out of the ground and so she's like connecting the dots and you know as we
evolve we'll explain more of like other technologies but to like that's if you
can explain it to a six-year-old hopefully you can explain it to another adult yeah i think the hardest part of
understanding it is like you can't see it like you see your food you see the plants that it grows on not everyone is
um you know from midland texas you don't get to see the rigs that actually drill or the pump jacks that are pumping the
oil so i think that's where it becomes like non-existent to some people
who don't see any energy infrastructure at all um and so it's interesting that you brought
up like two parts so yes we had on our last episode k mccall who she divided up
energy into two parts one was power yeah which is your turbine
so any wind exactly what you're saying yeah and the other side of it would be i can't remember what she called it i
don't know if y'all remember but basically
oil and gas like what else do we make from that like aside energy aside
from like power generation okay um which you kind of already touched on like
we need petroleum to make all the things we use right there's yeah so i mean
so the energy side is i would consider the energy side of it as like power and electricity that to
me when i think energy that's what i think however there's another component the petrochemical side
and the petrochemical side is extremely important and that's where i think you're gonna see
a lot of demand growth on the petrochemical side um you're gonna need a lot more of that
because you're creating more goods right as as economies continue to evolve
the demand for energy and the demand for just overall stuff that we see and use every day increases um and arguably like
the world's economies are continuing to grow you know again that's debatable right now but
for all extensive purposes you have emerging economies like india and china and stuff they're just continuing to use more stuff
so in order to create more stuff you have the other side of of the energy industry that helps create
feedstock for a lot and feedstock or like materials so when you extract oil and gas there's byproducts
after you separate it through heat and other forms of doing that but again in genes
being in very generalities you have when you extract stuff out of the ground you can use some of that to use to create
electricity and then you can use a lot of that for whether it be fertilizer whether it be
you know chemicals like that you get used in plastics and so that i would separate like the power and then the
petrochemical side and you you can always again you can break it down further and anyone who's
listening is probably like well yeah but this yeah but yeah like i know everyone you know like take it easy um i'm trying
to keep it very simple um i think that on that point that is where
um the industry really lacks like they like to over complicate the way they explain
things because it is very in-depth and technical but you can't you if you were to tell me all the
technical stuff i'd be like yeah okay bye yeah but yeah yeah interest so you have to keep it high level so you do you notice it like
on tick tock colin will make an explainer video and they're like you mess up this like actually it's this and
it's all right that's not the point and that it doesn't matter to people outside of the industry and that's
ultimately who we need to talk to right yeah and like whether it's you know because again everyone claims to be an
expert like you know tick tock's a great example i was so i started this little take talk
account which i go on there and i just like speak my mind like if i think of something i'll go on there i'll say it and whether it's like talking about oil
and gas markets sales anything and i wasn't this is the funniest thing so i was in i
was in colorado and i was in frisco colorado so up in the mountains
and like for 14 chicken wings was like 27 or something and so i so of course i was
like oh that's crazy like take out my phone i'm like do a tick tock thing i'm like 27 for chicken wings are you kidding me
and like just kind of joking and then i i was not expecting this but like so
many people went on there and were like thanks biden like fighting this and like everyone like
started getting so mad at like biden over this post and i was like okay like
comment section on tick tock is wild yeah that's where all the juice is right yeah so but so then i so then i started
replying and i was like well i i have a hard time thinking that like biden is single-handedly causing
chick-flation that's what i was calling it so i made it yeah and so then i like made another post i'm like okay like to clear things
up like yeah i get it like everyone is is an economist now and you know everyone understands inflation and
everyone's an expert but like let's consider supply and demand here and then everyone was like no but this and that
and then i was like okay i need to stop so i like totally stopped responding but to the point of everyone's an expert
is this like yeah and like i commend colin for doing that like he's talking about like random components and
different things within and then like educating people and to go on there and then like try and
it's a term down here everyone i guess knows but i learned this recently out whataburger somebody is that have you heard that i've never heard that oh okay
well when like when you go like you know one-uppers like i'm gonna one-up you it's like if you went to a concert well
the concert i went to was way better like yeah i should have been the one i was at well yeah everyone like seems to think that like their comments are what
they know is that much smarter um but ultimately it's like it doesn't matter like the fact that like unless it
was like completely off scales like if colin was talking about like a wind turbine that you used to drill oil and
gas for i'd be like okay like maybe you can correct course you can clear that up to get into the nuances and the details
it's like he's not trying to teach a like a graduate level engineering course he's trying to help people who don't
understand the industry so let's not get caught up in the in the semantics here um but yeah it's it's
it's crazy and to keep it high level it's again that that is a great point is we have a hard time in oil and gas
explaining what we do um but then you have all these scientists and engineers like i'm gonna
show you how smart i am i was like no one gives a they just want to understand what's going on like can you not simplify it please yeah yeah yeah on
that note gonna like do a little test can you simplify what you do to us
uh yeah so when you drill for oil and gas i'm gonna assume people understand what
drilling is that's right okay so you yeah you have this big machine that sits on the on the dirt and it drills down to
get to the pool of oil and then it just gushes everywhere right like that's okay so but in order to get there you need a
fluid that is pumped down to where you can
if you're in a like let's kill let's go to the beach everyone close your eyes and support me when you're digging to get to china right at the beach because
everyone knows if you dig deep enough you can get to china what happens when you start digging what happens the
sand gets wet yeah and then what happens it starts to fall in right like you dig
the more time i've never done that i'm like what happened i was just at the beach and i'm like what happened
so you dig down and then all of a sudden you get down there and and then the the sand wants to fall in and you're like well i can't see china yet so you keep
digging and just china never appears but if actually side note if you dig deep enough here in texas to get to where you
can dig to china you won't actually get to china i thought anywhere in the world if you dig deep enough you just somehow end up in china but apparently not i've
never heard that no okay well maybe that's a canadian thing i've no i've heard that book okay thank you
i'm not that crazy that's actually true right no no no you're right no these are the questions that are not dumb yes if you
dig deep enough right now here in houston texas i don't think you'll end up in china
uh although it would be funny if you did but i firmly believe that growing up in british columbia if i dug deep enough i
would get to china but i soon found out that if you dig deep enough what happens is the dirt and the sand falls back in
on itself so how would you get that sand and dirt from falling in how you would
well what i do is i provide drilling fluid so i i provide chemicals in engineering on
site meaning at the rig and we add chemicals to the fluid that gets
pumped to make sure that all that rock and dirt can get lifted out of the ground so you can keep digging deeper
because if you just like say if you kept digging now if if your hand somehow had something that could like pump fluid and
like kick and spray all that dirt everywhere you might get to china yeah like at the end of your fingers if you could
shoot more more water down there you might be able to get deep enough to china so
it's not again so if you're digging uh you know on a rig you're digging and you're drilling um
i help provide fluid to where you can continue to dig and and what happens is
as you get deeper there's there's this phenomenon called
reservoir pressure okay and what that is is as you dig deeper the pressure one it wants to cave in like the and that's how
ultimately oil and gas gets pushed out of the ground is because there's pressure when you dig deep there's pressure now
everyone's not well what about conventionals and sometimes it's depleted yeah yeah yeah whatever but ultimately the deeper you get the more
pressure there is okay so but in but as you're drilling you don't want all that pressure to shoot uh
like fluid and gas back at you because it's very dangerous so the fluid that i provide has a certain density and by
that i mean it's heavy so when you did when you drill it helps keep the hole open to where you don't
have gas and oil shooting back at you because you don't want that you only want that when you're ready to actually extract the oil in the gas but as you're
drilling to get there you want to hold it back so that you don't have uh issues
so that's what basically suppresses and keeps the hole open yeah it keeps the hole open so you can drill two
to pleasure island which is the island which is the reservoir which is the oil
and the gas yeah where the gold is yeah yeah or the black gold yeah yeah okay that makes sense to me do
you all have any questions about it no but we're gonna go into rapid fire you ready yes wow so i had no questions
i explained that perfectly i don't know if i did the company i work for is probably like
dude we should you should probably yeah and we're questioning
we probably don't even know if you said anything wrong yeah like yeah i mean yeah
especially going all the way to china right now we haven't dug to china yet but if we do i'll be the one to provide
the fluid for it all right here we go okay what is the
number one misconception about the energy industry the energy or oiling or oil and gases
okay um that we're all out to ruin the earth and make as much money as humanly possible
so would you say that because i kind of believe this that i think um
people in the industry it's like the environment is more top of mind than
anyone else like i think that we are doing a good job of trying to
minimize yeah like our effect on and i think that it is top of mind for oil and gas
companies more than anyone else would you say that i would say that and again i you know i'm somewhat biased because i
don't have exposure to other industries who do operate in remote
areas that ultimately do you know dig dirt and take forest away
and everything else however if you look at land reclamation especially up in canada when an oil and
gas company or an energy company goes and does their work are responsible for leaving that
basically area or that land in better or in the same or better condition
than what they left when they got there yeah so yes it is a lot of oil now granted it
depends on the on the company right like a lot of these huge companies like
they have a bullseye on their back cause if anything happens and they're the ones you know you're not you're not looking at all these small mom and pops that you
know if all of a sudden they burn a rig down like you're gonna hear about it but if like an exxon or a chevron does it
like then it's severe but i can say this through time and i've been
in oil and gas since 2004 is the emphasis on environmental protection land
reclamation making sure that they protect groundwater there they have spent more money and and r d on making
sure that they minimize the effects on the environment then i would imagine a lot of other
industries um you know and and one of the biggest things right now is is the methane you
know the flaring that's a huge topic of discussion and there's a lot of companies out there that are trying to come up with
technologies to minimize that and find ways well now with gas at almost ten dollars per i mean btu that's people are
finding ways to try and get it to market to sell it but for a while gas was cheap and no one knew what to do with it so they just let it they just flared it and
so but but but now there's a lot of you know policy and a lot of mandates
in place to say okay we got to minimize flaring and a lot of companies are spending a lot of money in time figuring
out how to do that and so yeah there's i mean especially here in the us and in canada like
the the environmental aspect of our industry is is extremely
important and a lot of companies like they spent a lot of time and effort
trying to minimize that and so but you don't see that right like it's kind of behind closed doors and they do
it and you know people can plug their iphones into the wall and it doesn't really mean anything it's you know what i mean so it's again to your point is
it's like you can't see them when they're doing that yeah um but it all
adds up at the end of the day to where the us is producing
in a way that's much safer and environmentally friendly than a lot of other parts of the world um
and i've seen it and i've experienced it and i've been in meetings and talking about like you know reducing the amount of water they use they're reducing the
amount of people that are on the road driving um those are just like a few of like
tons of other things but there's these little things that make people could grasp is like oh they're you know
because when you frac a well it it uses a ton of water well there everyone's trying to
reduce the amount of water we use because you know it's somewhat finite so um but yes oil and gas companies
i mean it's crazy to see how much money and time they put into that because you know investors want it right now if
you're an investor you want to invest in companies that have the you know the environment
um like they have the if you're if you're on the investment side most companies want to invest in
companies that have uh like good esg metrics environmental like friendly and
yeah i also think getting standard efficiency in some aspect
yeah um it it does um
again i can't i wouldn't i don't have enough experience on the operator side
to say if they operate more sustainably and they have a better esg sort of certain esg standards or
environmental standards that they operate more efficiently i i don't know that per se
i wouldn't want to come out here and say yeah if if companies have a of good environmental standards they're going to operate more efficiently but
it's more efficient for the entire ecosystem to operate more efficiently because ultimately then investors are going to want to invest in companies
that do operate in a good manner um to where then yeah it's if we can
produce more here in the us then that obviously that that would be much better so anyway
that yeah it's it'd be hard to make that parallel i didn't mean to uh hijack your rapid fire but i do want to plug in so
we are doing a vlog series with presidio petroleum and they we just this week released an episode um and it's all
about their like how they're lowering emissions and their operations
so i found it very very interesting and i think that other people would too it's just their
take on it as an oil and gas company is very interesting that's kind of why i had
kind of some conclusions but yeah it could be just them but i hope like they're the future and others will
follow yeah yeah no i i mean that would be something i need to do more research on on that as well but and what was the
operator's name presidio patron nice no good for them that's awesome yeah all right yeah um we kind
of touched base on this one but why should i like someone that doesn't know anything about the oil and gas industry
or the energy industry why should i care um you shouldn't
i'm just kidding yeah don't worry about it um i just
make our lives easier yeah it'll be there just keep paying your bills that'll be fine um
yeah you know i that's it that's actually a really good question why should you care be and because it it
it indirectly and directly impacts your life and it impacts your kids lives um
and i i think that the more people can be educated they can make
sort of educated decisions right knowledge is power yeah that's exactly and so i think it just comes down to
having a better understanding and and it helps just guide your decision making um whether that's conserving like
so for someone like yourself and and i and i know this because i've spoken to people that you know are in their 20s
they make a lot of their buying decisions based off of company values so
you know whether you're going to the store and if you see a you know a shirt that like oh we you know we you know a
portion of our proceeds goes to whatever environmental company versus noaa like
the behavior of consumers right now is like i want to buy stuff that i align with this company values so
yeah and so if you have an understanding of like energy and oil and gas it might help you make better buying
decisions not like t-shirts but yeah um it helps you understand why your why your electricity
bill is probably going to be double i don't know if you pay your electricity bill but i lived in new york and uh i
yeah i got a big understanding yeah every month when i my con ed bill was coming in right so in the summer price
is getting higher you know yeah so here on a macro level it allows you okay so ultimately
whoever our administration is whether it's you know blue green red purple whatever um well there's only two here
in the us but uh so it allows you to make better decisions when you're voting for who and
it allows you to understand policy and i think that's where ultimately if you have an understanding of energy
a lot of when people when the president voting comes up a lot of their initiatives are energy policy and energy
security and so if you at least have some basic understanding of that then it might help you justify why
you're voting for somebody um not to make it political but ultimately if you vote for someone who
let's just say is like we want to stop on the gas production period well at least then understand that your electricity and all your energy prices
are going to go up on top of that we're still going to use that oil and gas so if we can't produce
it where are we going to get it from oh we're going to depend on people from overseas and if we do that then we're giving up our energy security and i'm
not going to go into energy security but that's a good sort of topic to google is what is energy security and so that was
one thing in our former administration was like energy independence um you know again no one's perfect i'm not blue i'm
not red i'm more purple than anything however there is something to be said about having a degree of energy independence
because that also increases our energy security and wars have been
happening for years over money and power and oil and so it
all ties together and it impacts us whether we want to admit it or not um it's again it's again like you said
the more knowledgeable you have the more you have an understanding of how it all ties together you can ultimately make
better decisions and more educated decisions than just off like emotion or headlines that we see every day yeah
yeah that's a really good answer um our last one that's my favorite one what is your most embarrassing story in your
career my most embarrassing story in my career oh that's a good one
let's see oh this is a good one and then after this i do have to bounce
ladies but so i started so i was when i graduated high school i didn't know what i wanted to do
so i started working drilling rigs so then i went from being a city boy who enjoyed you know the finer things of
life partying ladies all that stuff as an 18 year old well i went from that to going to work on a drilling rig well the
drilling rig that i worked on only had two crews and for everyone out there who doesn't know normally have more than two
crews so that you can circulate but you if you only have two crews that means that you don't really get days off
um and so when that was happening so i got onto the rig
and i was like so yeah this this two week on two week off thing and they're like no buddy like you're out here until
we tell you you can go home and i was like but i thought oh okay never mind so anyway um
we're gonna rig and it had been like three weeks and i was like i really want to go home like i went from being at home like
comfort of my parents house to now working on a drilling rig and i don't know when i'm going home this sucks i
hated it and i was a leasehand and part of my job on a day-to-day basis was cleaning the
like the rigs toilets and like the bathrooms and in canada the trailer
the tool pushers trailer and the tool pusher is kind of like the boss on the rig well anyway at the end of his trailer was the bathroom so one day i
was cleaning the bathroom and i i was trying to figure out like how i could get home um and i was like well wait you know
like i have you know a wedding coming up i was like okay so but i was too embarrassed to go into the
to the my boss's trailer through the front door but from the bathroom to the door um or from like the bathroom that i
was cleaning there was a door to his office and i heard him in there on the phone and so i waited in the bathroom until he
was done on the phone then i knocked on the door and his name was daryl and he was like hello i was like hey daryl this is
justin i'm cleaning your the bathroom right now i was wondering if you had a minute and he's like what the hell are you doing calling me from the bathroom
uh i don't know and so he opened the door he's like you're the first person that's ever done he's like what do you want like well uh
i haven't been home in my i have a wedding coming up i was wondering if i could be home uh for you know i gave him a date
and uh he didn't give me an answer but that was like looking back if if i was a like a boss and some kid
like was cleaning the bathroom and knocked on the door to ask for days off i would have probably ran him off and
been don't ever ask me for days off while you're cleaning the bathroom that's just so awkward and so it's not really that
embarrassing but it's like in looking back at it like i was i didn't know how to approach my boss and so yeah i was
sitting there with like a scrub brush and like like gloves and stuff like cleaning the bathroom asking for time off like looking back like i wasn't
embarrassed at the time but now i'm like wow that was extremely embarrassing yeah i don't know why i thought of that
scrubbing the toilet hey boss by the way can i uh go home tomorrow yeah like can i yeah can i can i have some days off
and the crappy thing is like he never gave me an answer for like two weeks so he kept like dragging it along and i was
like god dang and then he finally was like okay he's like look yes you can you can go home for these dates but then you
gotta come back you know these dates he's like but if you ever ask me for time off from the bathroom again you
might as well not come back i was like okay noted yeah i'll come in through the front door instead of through the bathroom yeah yeah so that was the
normal thing i'm sure he's probably this dumb kid but yeah um that's i don't know if that's the most embarrassing but i'm
embarrassed to like describe that so i don't really get that much too much but yeah that was yeah that does work
highlight of my career for sure yeah yeah well cool thanks for coming on i know you have a
meeting to run to no worries this has been fun yeah you ladies are crushing it and i'm super pumped to see how this
evolves and like i said evolve or die right yeah exactly yeah i think we'll have you on when we know a little bit
more and you can talk to us more in depth yeah no worries i hope i did an okay job again it's i'm working on
explaining things simply to people who don't quite understand it um so i think this is a good exercise and a great
platform to do that so i commend you ladies that's such a good idea awesome well thank you justin
you're welcome thank you guys should we plug your podcast oh should our non-existent followers
you guys are gonna have a lot i'll make sure my mom subscribes thank you yeah we got one subscriber our moms
or yeah yeah no my mom's always like i listen to your podcast again i was like yeah so yeah if you wanna so again i have a
podcast wicked energy with jg you can find it on all directories um and it focuses around having discussions about
um you know a lot of the challenges the innovation the transition uh and in through through uh speaking and
interviewing energy thought leaders and so um yeah just continuing to educate dive deep into a lot of the challenges
and and just some really good discussion on oil and gas whether it's technology policy
um you know the transition sort of all things good for energy so and then two is like how a lot of the
conversation i like to have is how can we help provide energy to the world because i think one of the problems is you know
it's one thing to help you know reduce emissions and everything else but i think the biggest problem we have
right now is energy poverty in lots of parts of the world is so how can we how can we allow for people to have
access to reliable abundant and affordable energy i think that needs to be the north star and then beyond that
we can continue focusing on you know reducing uh emissions and and all you know the greenhouse gas effects and
everything else but but that's a privilege yeah it is right and so there's countries out there who don't care about emitting they just want to be
able to heat their hospitals and have electricity so they can have babies in a nice environment versus on a dirt floor
so keep that in mind yes well thank you justin yeah thank you
